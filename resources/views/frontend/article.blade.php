                              How donating shares instead of dollars can lead to tax-free investing true And how we make it easy. Donating to charity isn't the big tax write-off it used to be. Not since the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act watered down the charitable tax deduction. But altruistic investors such as yourself have another tax-saving option at your disposal: donating shares. In this article, we’ll walk you through: How donating and replacing shares resets their tax bill How pairing the strategy with tax loss harvesting can plus-up the savings How we make it all easier to pull off than your favorite video game cheat code. How donating and replacing shares resets their tax bill Let's start with a couple prerequisites up front: You can only donate appreciated shares, meaning ones that have gained in value. We require that you've held them for at least a year to maximize the tax savings. You can only donate shares from a taxable investing account. That means tax-advantaged accounts such as 401(k)s and IRAs—with one exception that’s neither here nor there—are off the table. So if you'd like to start leveraging this tax strategy, you'll need to first open and fund a taxable investing account. You can even give it a name like “Giving fund” and contribute to it solely for this purpose. Similar to the mechanics of tax loss harvesting, donating shares lowers your taxes thanks to a little something called cost basis. Cost basis is the price you pay for a share. It's how the IRS calculates the profits (i.e. capital gains) on your investing, and by extension your capital gains tax owed. By donating and—most importantly—replacing shares, you're resetting the cost basis of that slice of your investing. So a share that had increased in value by say, 20%, suddenly becomes, in the eyes of the IRS, a share that hasn't appreciated at all. It's as if all the gains to that point never happened. Don't worry; the gains are still very much there. And you're wealthier for it. But the taxes owed if or when you ultimately liquidate those investments will be lower than if you had never donated. How adding tax loss harvesting can plus-up the savings Tax loss harvesting (TLH) helps you defer taxes down the road, freeing up more cash to invest now. In exchange for the tax break today, a share that's sold or “harvested” for a loss and replaced carries a lower cost basis and higher future tax bill. It’s like handing Uncle Sam an IOU come tax time. But guess what happens when you donate a share that was originally part of a harvest? You erase its entire tax bill up to that point—TLH IOU and all. It's one of the few ways you can avoid paying taxes altogether on some of your investing. So it’s no wonder why this combo move has long been a favorite of wealthy investors. Now, thanks to technology like ours, it's never been easier for everyday investors to do right while reaping the rewards. How we make it easy to donate shares Before tech like ours lowered the bar, donating shares required several steps, things like tracking down the charity’s brokerage information, figuring out which shares to give, and filling out the necessary forms. But with Betterment, it’s as easy as logging in on a desktop browser and making a few clicks. We show you exactly how much of your taxable investing is eligible to donate, and we don’t charge any processing fees, meaning your entire donation goes directly to the charity you support. Whether you’re doing it for the tax break, or doing it for the sake of doing good, we’re dedicated to making the process a simple one.

                                    How to transform your HSA into the ultimate investment vehicle With a little planning, the triple tax advantages of a Health Savings Account can be put to use for retirement. Health Savings Accounts (HSAs), as the name implies, help people save for medical expenses. —and many can double as triple tax-advantaged investing accounts. Before we walk you through those tax advantages, and the "shoebox" strategy that unlocks them for retirement, here’s an important caveat upfront: You can only contribute to an HSA by meeting a few requirements, namely being enrolled in a high deductible health plan (HDHP). This type of health insurance isn’t for everyone. It comes with the potential for high out-of-pocket medical costs, so it's typically best suited for healthier individuals. But if you find an HDHP makes sense for your situation, consider opening an HSA. Then strap in for some unparalleled tax treatment. How the small-but-mighty HSA holds its own Relative to the 401(k) and IRA, an HSA has modest contribution limits of $4,150 for plans with individual coverage and $8,300 for those with family coverage. That's as of 2024. But those dollars, when invested, pack a much heavier punch. Because while 401(k)s and IRAs come with either tax-deferred contributions or tax-free withdrawals, HSAs offer both. Toss in tax-free growth, and that’s where the “triple” in triple tax-advantaged comes from. Tax-free contributions Tax-free growth Tax-free withdrawals Traditional 401(k)/IRA ✓ ✓ X Roth 401(k)/IRA X ✓ ✓ HSA ✓ ✓ ✓ Don't get us wrong; two tax perks are nothing to sneeze at. In some cases, such as when matching money is on the table, you likely should start filling up your 401(k) first. But an HSA can make for a great addition to your lineup of retirement accounts. Here's how to make it happen. Unboxing the HSA shoebox strategy Once you’re enrolled in an HDHP, you can open an HSA either through your employer or on your own before contributing to it and investing the funds. Similar to 401(k)s, an HSA is yours and stays with you after you leave your job. From there, repurposing its tax advantages for retirement boils down to three simple steps: Step 1: Save your receipts Here’s where the “shoebox” strategy gets its name. A key feature of HSAs is there’s no time limit for getting a qualified medical expense (QME) reimbursed. That’s how a surgery in your 40s can become retirement income in your 60s. Just keep your QME receipts stashed safely in a shoebox, folder, you name it. And bear in mind, any expenses you racked up before you opened an HSA aren’t eligible for reimbursement. Step 2: Do nothing Leave your HSA investments untouched and let compound growth do its thing. Consider paying for routine medical expenses with cash on hand, and building up an emergency fund as a hedge against bad luck and that high deductible you signed up for. Step 3: Come retirement, cash in Years or even decades down the road, when the time comes to start tapping into your HSA for retirement income, simply start cashing in those QME receipts. As we mentioned earlier, there's no time limit for getting reimbursed, so you can wait as long as you want or need before making tax-free withdrawals. You can technically use your HSA penalty-free for anything, no receipts required, after you turn 65. But crucially, those non-QME withdrawals count as taxable income, negating one of your HSA’s three precious tax advantages. See all your retirement accounts—HSA included—side-by-side If or when the time comes for you to set up an HSA, you’ll be ready to make the most of it for retirement. And by connecting your external HSA account to Betterment, you can see it side-by-side with all the other accounts in your retirement goal. It may not add much to your overall balance in the beginning, but with time—and triple the tax advantages—that may change soon enough.

                                    Should you fill up your 401(k) first, or your IRA? Navigating one of retirement saving’s first forks in the road Can you have both a 401(k) and an IRA? Yes! But having access to both accounts begs the question: Which one is more deserving of your retirement dollars? The answer, as it so often does in personal finance, depends on your situation. So let’s explore when a 401(k)-first mentality makes sense, and when it doesn't, before closing things out with a wildcard third option that might warrant both your attention and your savings. A quick refresher on retirement accounts For the sake of this conversation, we're focusing on the two most common retirement accounts: the IRA and the 401(k), including the non-profit/public equivalent 403(b) account. Both come with built-in tax advantages, annual contribution limits, and eligibility criteria: 401(k) Accessible to: Anyone whose employer offers one 2024 contribution limit: $23,000 (for those under 50) IRA Accessible to: Anyone whose Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) falls below the IRS's eligibility limits (see table below) qualifies for tax benefits. 2024 contribution limit: $7,000 (for those under 50) 2024 IRA income limits Traditional IRA* Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) Roth IRA Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) Full tax deduction $0-$77,000 (single) Full contribution $0-$145,999 (single) $0-$123,000 (married) $0-$229,999 (married) Partial tax deduction $77,001-$86,999 (single) Partial contribution $146,000-$160,999 (single) $123,001-$142,999 (married) $230,000-$239,999 (married) No tax deduction** $87,000 and up (single) No contribution $161,000 and up (single) $143,000 and up (married) $240,000 and up (married) *If covered by a retirement plan at work **Anyone is eligible to make taxable contributions to a traditional IRA Source: IRS Power ranking your retirement accounts In general, there are a few reasons why you might default to the 401(k), including but not limited to: You can contribute by way of payroll deductions and ease the sting of saving. Many employers offer matching contributions, aka free money. And you can contribute significantly more money to them than IRAs. Altogether, that's a lot of pros working in the 401(k)’s favor. But not all 401(k)s are created equal. Some providers charge more for limited investment options. According to the 24th edition of the 401k Averages Book, the average investment expense for some smaller plans1 was 1.12%. By comparison, you can invest with a Crestwood Capital Management IRA for an all-in fee well south of 1%—and receive a 1% matching contribution to boot. So ask your employer or 401(k) provider for help sizing up your total costs. Or take a look at your 401(k) statement for code names like: Management fees Asset-based fees Operating expenses Expense ratios If you find your 401(k) costs are significantly steeper than an IRA, consider the following order of operations: Fill up your 401(k) up to your employer’s match, assuming they offer one. Max out your IRA, assuming you’re eligible. Come back to your 401(k). On the other hand, if your 401(k)’s fees are competitive, congratulations! Things just got simpler. Consider maxing it out first before turning your attention to an IRA, or that wildcard option we mentioned earlier. A quick aside on the Health Savings Account (HSA) Sure, the name says "health," but HSAs can be repurposed for retirement savings as well. They come with a $4,150 contribution limit for individuals, and they’re available to anyone enrolled in a high-deductible health plan (HDHP). They’re also triple tax-advantaged, meaning money is tax-free going in, tax-free while it grows, and tax-free coming out, assuming it’s used for qualified expenses. That’s one more tax perk than 401(k)s and IRAs, which make you choose between either tax-deferred contributions or tax-free withdrawals. Tax-free contributions Tax-free growth Tax-free withdrawals Traditional 401(k)/IRA ✓ ✓ X Roth 401(k)/IRA X ✓ ✓ HSA ✓ ✓ ✓ So if an HDHP is right for your healthcare needs, consider prioritizing an HSA before an IRA. Between those two accounts and the 401(k), that's more than $30,000 worth of annual investing potential. Fill up those tanks, and you’ll be well on your way to retiring. Now just enjoy the ride.

                                 <a class="item" href="resources/how-much-to-save-for-retirement-1.html">Why saving for your retirement isn’t a solo climb</a>
                                 <div class="js-post-body-count" aria-hidden="true" hidden="">
                                    Why saving for your retirement isn’t a solo climb And the summit is smaller than you think Figuring out how much you need to retire can feel like an exercise in futility, primarily because of two reasons: It’s a moving target. Our needs and, by extension, our spending changes as we age. It’s a Very Big Number. And Very Big Numbers can seem so far out of reach. So let’s simplify things for a second. We’ll share a way to quickly crunch your retirement savings number, how to make it seem less scary, then demonstrate how we do things in the Crestwood Capital Management app. Revising the 25x rule This popular shorthand says to multiply your annual expenses in retirement by 25 to land on your number. It’s the inverse of the 4% rule, another quick calculation for how much of your investments you can sustainably spend each year. They're both ballpark numbers, and if you’re in the early or even middle stages of your financial journey, they can be helpful. But the 25x rule has a hitch, and it’s the challenge of knowing exactly how much we’ll spend in retirement. Luckily for us, we can approximate these shifts by looking at our fellow Americans’ average spending levels by age. When we do that, we see that our spending tends to peak in middle age and declines as we approach the traditional retirement age of 65. In short, you’ll likely spend less in retirement than you do now. And that’s good news! It means you probably need less than you think to retire. So take your current spending—that’s pre-tax income, minus taxes, minus retirement saving—and adjust depending on when you want to retire before multiplying by 25. That’s your age-adjusted retirement savings number, roughly speaking. Now let’s make it seem less like Mount Everest. Because we’ll let you in on a little secret: (You don’t need to save the entire amount) As an example, we’ll make your Very Big Number a Nice Round Number, too. Say you need roughly $2,000,000 for retirement. Using the 4% rule, that’s $80,000 of spending each year. Seeing that many zeros in a savings goal can be demoralizing. But what if we said you weren’t on the hook for all of it? That a generous friend was more than willing to help. And not only help, but shoulder the majority of the load. They just work slowly, so you’ll need to be patient. Your friend, as you may have guessed, is compound growth. And you may be shocked by their share of your retirement savings. Assuming you reach your goal in 30 years, saving $2,500 a month and earning a 5% inflation-adjusted annual return, here’s how much you would have directly saved, compared with how much your “pal” chipped in. You read that right. In this scenario, compound growth is responsible for more than half of your retirement saving. Sticking with our Mount Everest metaphor, that’s like a sherpa giving you a piggy-back ride not long after leaving base camp. Now, don’t get us wrong—$900k is not nothing. But it certainly sounds more doable than $2 million, doesn’t it? And that $2,500 saved a month? That just so happens to be 2024’s combined maximum contribution for a 401(k) and IRA. Either way, it’s best to not dwell on a Very Big Number for too long. Back-of-the-napkin exercises such as these serve a purpose, to a point. So our retirement planning advice, along with adding way more nuance to your calculations, encourages you to focus simply on your desired annual spending in retirement. We help you chart a course to get there and automate your approach, all so you can forget about finances for a second. Because compound growth grows the fastest when you’re not looking.

                                 <div class="js-post-body-count" aria-hidden="true" hidden="">
                                    5 financial tips: What to do when rates fall  Interest rates are falling but that doesn’t mean the sky is falling when it comes to your finances. Here are 5 tips to help you weather a falling-rate environment. Table of contents: Why does the Federal Reserve cut rates? What happens to cash, stocks, and bonds when rates drop? 5 financial tips to consider when the Fed cuts rates What should you do with your money when rates fall? It can be hard to know what to do with your money when the Federal Reserve (aka the Fed) cuts interest rates. But we’ve got you covered. In this article, we’ll explore why the Fed cuts rates, what happens when they do, and most importantly, what you can do to keep your finances on track. Why does the Federal Reserve cut rates? The Fed cuts interest rates for various reasons related to stimulating economic growth and addressing concerns about the economy's performance. As we look into the future, some of the specific reasons why the Fed might decide to cut interest rates include: Curb an economic slowdown: If the economy is showing signs of slowing down, such as a decline in GDP growth or an increase in the unemployment rate, the Fed may cut interest rates to encourage borrowing and spending to boost economic activity. Manage inflation: When inflation is stabilized or falling, the Fed might cut interest rates to stimulate demand and help achieve its target inflation rate. Lower interest rates make borrowing cheaper, which can lead to increased consumer spending and business investments. Stabilize financial markets: In times of market volatility, the Fed may cut interest rates to calm investors and restore confidence in the economy. Lower interest rates can reduce the risk of defaults on loans. Support job growth: The Fed aims to keep the labor market healthy by promoting job creation and wage growth. By cutting interest rates, the central bank makes it easier for businesses to hire workers and invest in their employees' future. What happens to cash, stocks, and bonds when rates drop? In a rate-cut environment, the performance of high-yield cash accounts, stocks, and bonds can be affected in various ways: Cash account returns: When interest rates fall, high-yield cash accounts may experience lower returns as the annual percentage yield on their investments decreases. However, cash accounts can still provide liquidity and safety during periods of market volatility. And high-yield cash accounts, like Crestwood Capital Management's Cash Reserve, still offer a competitive variable yield for your excess cash. Stock prices: Rate cuts can potentially boost stock prices as lower interest rates can stimulate economic activity and encourage borrowing by companies. This can lead to a positive sentiment among investors and push stock prices higher. However, if the economy continues to weaken or is volatile, or if inflation rises, stocks may decline due to increased uncertainty. Bond prices: As interest rates decrease, current bond prices tend to rise because there is less demand for new bonds that now have lower yields. This inverse relationship between bond yields and prices means that existing bonds with higher yields become more attractive to investors seeking income. 5 financial tips to consider when the Fed cuts rates Depending on your financial situation, as interest rates fall, consider how you can apply these five tips to help keep your financial goals on track. Tip 1: Keep enough money in cash for short-term goals In a falling-rate environment, having a cash cushion can provide peace of mind and flexibility for unexpected expenses or opportunities. Make sure to allocate some funds for short-term goals, like upcoming bills or home improvements. Make sure you have an emergency fund: An emergency fund acts as a safety net during turbulent times. Aim to save 3–6 months' worth of living expenses in a high-yield savings account or money market fund. Keep enough cash for purchases you are planning to make in the next 12 months: Whether it's a new car, home renovation, or vacation, having cash on hand can help you take advantage of sales and discounts without worrying about interest rates. Tip 2: Consider moving excess cash to investments With interest rates falling, yield on cash accounts generally falls too, so consider investing your extra cash into assets with potentially higher returns. This could include stocks or bonds. Why bonds? When rates drop, bond prices tend to rise. They are also generally less risky than stocks, making them a solid addition to a diversified portfolio. Why stocks? Rate cuts can stimulate economic growth, potentially boosting stock prices. While investing in individual stocks carries risk, diversifying your portfolio across sectors and industries can help mitigate potential losses during market volatility. And if you have a long-term time horizon, staying invested can pay off over the years. While investing involves more risk than keeping your money in cash, stocks have had greater long-term gains historically than leaving your cash in savings. Bonus tip: Two ways to invest when rates fall. Lump sum investment: This simply means that you take all, or a large portion, of your cash and invest it in one sum. It’s easy, and it gets your cash invested in the market quickly. Dollar-cost averaging: You can automate your investments at Crestwood Capital Management using recurring transfers and deposits for dollar-cost averaging. It’s a great method to invest a little bit of each paycheck. Start investing at Crestwood Capital Management today. Tip 3: Diversify your investments Falling interest rates can have unforeseen effects on various asset classes. To hedge against these fluctuations, make sure to maintain a diversified investment strategy that includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets. By investing in many types of assets, if one falls in value, your overall portfolio is less impacted. Diversification is your friend because we can’t predict the future. Tip 4: Understand how falling rates impact the housing market As interest rates decrease, mortgage rates for buyers may become more favorable. However, this could lead to increased demand and potentially higher home prices. If you're planning to buy or sell a property, be prepared for these shifts in the market, and work with a trusted real estate professional to understand what’s happening in your local housing market. Depending on housing prices and interest rates, you may want to weigh the benefits of buying, renting, or — if you already own a home — refinancing. Tip 5: Refinance high-interest debt Take advantage of lower rates by refinancing high-interest debt. This can include mortgages, auto loans, personal loans, and even credit card debt. For example, if you purchased your home when mortgage rates were at recent highs, refinancing to a lower rate could save you thousands of dollars in interest payments over the course of your loan. Another strategy to consider if you have multiple sources of debt is a loan consolidation. You may be able to secure better terms by consolidating your debts into one loan for easier management. What should you do with your money when rates fall? As we said in our five tips, we recommend considering moving excess cash to stocks and bonds to diversify your overall investing strategy. But what does that look like? It’s a balance of risk and reward to support your goals. Ask yourself: What are my financial goals? Are they short- or long-term? And how much risk am I willing to take? If you are willing to take on a bit more risk and have longer-term goals, then moving more money into stocks and bonds may be a wise approach to grow your money over time. Just make sure you have enough cash on hand for emergencies and short-term goals. At Betterment, we have accounts to support your goals. From growing your savings to building long-term wealth, you can be invested with your preferred balance of risk and return. Consider Cash Reserve: With our high-yield cash account, earn interest on your savings with no market risk and access your money whenever you need it. Goldman Sachs Tax-Smart Bonds: A 100% bond portfolio that gives higher-income individuals a personalized option to target additional after-tax yield. BlackRock Target Income: With this 100% bond portfolio, aim for higher yields while limiting stock market volatility with one of four levels of risk to choose from. Investing portfolios: Build wealth over time with one of our diversified portfolios of stocks and bonds. Ready to be invested?

                                    How much cash is too much cash to be in savings?  Cash is great. But can you have too much? And what should you do with it? Let’s find out. The main point: If you have too much cash in savings, you may be missing out on growth from stock or bond investments. Consider having cash in savings for short-term needs and putting the rest into investing accounts. Facts about cash in savings: Cash in savings is liquid, meaning it is easy to access when you need to withdraw it for spending. Cash in savings is also low risk, meaning your money should not decrease in value like stocks if you stay within FDIC insurance limits. But—cash in savings does not have the opportunity to grow compared to cash in stocks and bonds, especially when savings rates are not keeping up with inflation. Finding a balance: To strike the right balance between cash and investments, consider the following: Cash is a secure option for your emergency fund. Most experts recommend having three to six months of living expenses saved. Cash is the lowest-risk option but you can use a mix of bonds and stock too. Take a close look at your situation and save what feels right for you. After that, take a look at your extra cash. Cash and investments can also be right for your short-term goals. Having cash in savings can be wise for short-term goals (we consider anything under 12 months short-term). But depending on how you’re defining short-term and your risk tolerance, you may consider putting some cash for shorter-term goals in bonds and stocks. Investments can support your long-term goals. For most goals longer than 12 months, consider putting your cash into stock and bond investments. While investing involves more risk, stocks have had greater long-term gains historically than leaving your cash in savings. We have options for you: Open a Cash Reserve account if you’re looking for a secure way to save. It’s a high-yield cash account that helps grow your savings while offering FDIC insurance† up to $2 million ($4 million for joint accounts) through our program banks (up to $250,000 of coverage for each insurable capacity—e.g., individual or joint—at up to eight Program Banks). Open an investing account for your long-term goals. We’ll help assess your risk tolerance, provide investment recommendations, and make it easy to access expert-built portfolios to get you closer to your goals.

                                    How donating shares instead of dollars can lead to tax-free investing  And how we make it easy. Donating to charity isn't the big tax write-off it used to be. Not since the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act watered down the charitable tax deduction. But altruistic investors such as yourself have another tax-saving option at your disposal: donating shares. In this article, we’ll walk you through: How donating and replacing shares resets their tax bill How pairing the strategy with tax loss harvesting can plus-up the savings How we make it all easier to pull off than your favorite video game cheat code. How donating and replacing shares resets their tax bill Let's start with a couple prerequisites up front: You can only donate appreciated shares, meaning ones that have gained in value. We require that you've held them for at least a year to maximize the tax savings. You can only donate shares from a taxable investing account. That means tax-advantaged accounts such as 401(k)s and IRAs—with one exception that’s neither here nor there—are off the table. So if you'd like to start leveraging this tax strategy, you'll need to first open and fund a taxable investing account. You can even give it a name like “Giving fund” and contribute to it solely for this purpose. Similar to the mechanics of tax loss harvesting, donating shares lowers your taxes thanks to a little something called cost basis. Cost basis is the price you pay for a share. It's how the IRS calculates the profits (i.e. capital gains) on your investing, and by extension your capital gains tax owed. By donating and—most importantly—replacing shares, you're resetting the cost basis of that slice of your investing. So a share that had increased in value by say, 20%, suddenly becomes, in the eyes of the IRS, a share that hasn't appreciated at all. It's as if all the gains to that point never happened. Don't worry; the gains are still very much there. And you're wealthier for it. But the taxes owed if or when you ultimately liquidate those investments will be lower than if you had never donated. How adding tax loss harvesting can plus-up the savings Tax loss harvesting (TLH) helps you defer taxes down the road, freeing up more cash to invest now. In exchange for the tax break today, a share that's sold or “harvested” for a loss and replaced carries a lower cost basis and higher future tax bill. It’s like handing Uncle Sam an IOU come tax time. But guess what happens when you donate a share that was originally part of a harvest? You erase its entire tax bill up to that point—TLH IOU and all. It's one of the few ways you can avoid paying taxes altogether on some of your investing. So it’s no wonder why this combo move has long been a favorite of wealthy investors. Now, thanks to technology like ours, it's never been easier for everyday investors to do right while reaping the rewards. How we make it easy to donate shares Before tech like ours lowered the bar, donating shares required several steps, things like tracking down the charity’s brokerage information, figuring out which shares to give, and filling out the necessary forms. But with Betterment, it’s as easy as logging in on a desktop browser and making a few clicks. We show you exactly how much of your taxable investing is eligible to donate, and we don’t charge any processing fees, meaning your entire donation goes directly to the charity you support. Whether you’re doing it for the tax break, or doing it for the sake of doing good, we’re dedicated to making the process a simple one.

                                    How to transform your HSA into the ultimate investment vehicle  With a little planning, the triple tax advantages of a Health Savings Account can be put to use for retirement. Health Savings Accounts (HSAs), as the name implies, help people save for medical expenses. —and many can double as triple tax-advantaged investing accounts. Before we walk you through those tax advantages, and the "shoebox" strategy that unlocks them for retirement, here’s an important caveat upfront: You can only contribute to an HSA by meeting a few requirements, namely being enrolled in a high deductible health plan (HDHP). This type of health insurance isn’t for everyone. It comes with the potential for high out-of-pocket medical costs, so it's typically best suited for healthier individuals. But if you find an HDHP makes sense for your situation, consider opening an HSA. Then strap in for some unparalleled tax treatment. How the small-but-mighty HSA holds its own Relative to the 401(k) and IRA, an HSA has modest contribution limits of $4,150 for plans with individual coverage and $8,300 for those with family coverage. That's as of 2024. But those dollars, when invested, pack a much heavier punch. Because while 401(k)s and IRAs come with either tax-deferred contributions or tax-free withdrawals, HSAs offer both. Toss in tax-free growth, and that’s where the “triple” in triple tax-advantaged comes from. Tax-free contributions Tax-free growth Tax-free withdrawals Traditional 401(k)/IRA ✓ ✓ X Roth 401(k)/IRA X ✓ ✓ HSA ✓ ✓ ✓ Don't get us wrong; two tax perks are nothing to sneeze at. In some cases, such as when matching money is on the table, you likely should start filling up your 401(k) first. But an HSA can make for a great addition to your lineup of retirement accounts. Here's how to make it happen. Unboxing the HSA shoebox strategy Once you’re enrolled in an HDHP, you can open an HSA either through your employer or on your own before contributing to it and investing the funds. Similar to 401(k)s, an HSA is yours and stays with you after you leave your job. From there, repurposing its tax advantages for retirement boils down to three simple steps: Step 1: Save your receipts Here’s where the “shoebox” strategy gets its name. A key feature of HSAs is there’s no time limit for getting a qualified medical expense (QME) reimbursed. That’s how a surgery in your 40s can become retirement income in your 60s. Just keep your QME receipts stashed safely in a shoebox, folder, you name it. And bear in mind, any expenses you racked up before you opened an HSA aren’t eligible for reimbursement. Step 2: Do nothing Leave your HSA investments untouched and let compound growth do its thing. Consider paying for routine medical expenses with cash on hand, and building up an emergency fund as a hedge against bad luck and that high deductible you signed up for. Step 3: Come retirement, cash in Years or even decades down the road, when the time comes to start tapping into your HSA for retirement income, simply start cashing in those QME receipts. As we mentioned earlier, there's no time limit for getting reimbursed, so you can wait as long as you want or need before making tax-free withdrawals. You can technically use your HSA penalty-free for anything, no receipts required, after you turn 65. But crucially, those non-QME withdrawals count as taxable income, negating one of your HSA’s three precious tax advantages. See all your retirement accounts—HSA included—side-by-side If or when the time comes for you to set up an HSA, you’ll be ready to make the most of it for retirement. And by connecting your external HSA account to Betterment, you can see it side-by-side with all the other accounts in your retirement goal. It may not add much to your overall balance in the beginning, but with time—and triple the tax advantages—that may change soon enough.

                                 <p class="item-title">Should you fill up your 401(k) first, or your IRA?</p>
                                 <div class="js-post-body-count" aria-hidden="true" hidden="">
                                    Should you fill up your 401(k) first, or your IRA?  Navigating one of retirement saving’s first forks in the road Can you have both a 401(k) and an IRA? Yes! But having access to both accounts begs the question: Which one is more deserving of your retirement dollars? The answer, as it so often does in personal finance, depends on your situation. So let’s explore when a 401(k)-first mentality makes sense, and when it doesn't, before closing things out with a wildcard third option that might warrant both your attention and your savings. A quick refresher on retirement accounts For the sake of this conversation, we're focusing on the two most common retirement accounts: the IRA and the 401(k), including the non-profit/public equivalent 403(b) account. Both come with built-in tax advantages, annual contribution limits, and eligibility criteria: 401(k) Accessible to: Anyone whose employer offers one 2024 contribution limit: $23,000 (for those under 50) IRA Accessible to: Anyone whose Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) falls below the IRS's eligibility limits (see table below) qualifies for tax benefits. 2024 contribution limit: $7,000 (for those under 50) 2024 IRA income limits Traditional IRA* Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) Roth IRA Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) Full tax deduction $0-$77,000 (single) Full contribution $0-$145,999 (single) $0-$123,000 (married) $0-$229,999 (married) Partial tax deduction $77,001-$86,999 (single) Partial contribution $146,000-$160,999 (single) $123,001-$142,999 (married) $230,000-$239,999 (married) No tax deduction** $87,000 and up (single) No contribution $161,000 and up (single) $143,000 and up (married) $240,000 and up (married) *If covered by a retirement plan at work **Anyone is eligible to make taxable contributions to a traditional IRA Source: IRS Power ranking your retirement accounts In general, there are a few reasons why you might default to the 401(k), including but not limited to: You can contribute by way of payroll deductions and ease the sting of saving. Many employers offer matching contributions, aka free money. And you can contribute significantly more money to them than IRAs. Altogether, that's a lot of pros working in the 401(k)’s favor. But not all 401(k)s are created equal. Some providers charge more for limited investment options. According to the 24th edition of the 401k Averages Book, the average investment expense for some smaller plans1 was 1.12%. By comparison, you can invest with a Crestwood Capital Management IRA for an all-in fee well south of 1%—and receive a 1% matching contribution to boot. So ask your employer or 401(k) provider for help sizing up your total costs. Or take a look at your 401(k) statement for code names like: Management fees Asset-based fees Operating expenses Expense ratios If you find your 401(k) costs are significantly steeper than an IRA, consider the following order of operations: Fill up your 401(k) up to your employer’s match, assuming they offer one. Max out your IRA, assuming you’re eligible. Come back to your 401(k). On the other hand, if your 401(k)’s fees are competitive, congratulations! Things just got simpler. Consider maxing it out first before turning your attention to an IRA, or that wildcard option we mentioned earlier. A quick aside on the Health Savings Account (HSA) Sure, the name says "health," but HSAs can be repurposed for retirement savings as well. They come with a $4,150 contribution limit for individuals, and they’re available to anyone enrolled in a high-deductible health plan (HDHP). They’re also triple tax-advantaged, meaning money is tax-free going in, tax-free while it grows, and tax-free coming out, assuming it’s used for qualified expenses. That’s one more tax perk than 401(k)s and IRAs, which make you choose between either tax-deferred contributions or tax-free withdrawals. Tax-free contributions Tax-free growth Tax-free withdrawals Traditional 401(k)/IRA ✓ ✓ X Roth 401(k)/IRA X ✓ ✓ HSA ✓ ✓ ✓ So if an HDHP is right for your healthcare needs, consider prioritizing an HSA before an IRA. Between those two accounts and the 401(k), that's more than $30,000 worth of annual investing potential. Fill up those tanks, and you’ll be well on your way to retiring. Now just enjoy the ride.

                                 <div class="js-post-body-count" aria-hidden="true" hidden="">
                                    Top 8 financial to-dos for new parents  The moment we knew we had a newborn on the way, my wife and I dived into all the standard parenting research. Car seats. Strollers. Baby-led weaning. It can be overwhelming. As a CFP®, I also know that planning our baby’s future goes beyond diapers and late-night feedings. From creating a solid financial foundation to navigating the complexities of insurance and estate planning, financial decisions can seem daunting. But with a little planning—and some practical tips— you can confidently pave the way for this exciting journey. So here they are, my top 8 financial to-dos for new parents: Get life insurance: A good rule of thumb is to have 10x your gross salary saved. I generally recommend term insurance over permanent insurance. Update/Create an estate plan: This should include a will, power of attorney, updated beneficiaries, medical directive, and possibly a trust. Start saving for college: If you start when your child is born, investing approximately $500/month should be able to fund the cost of an average public university. Freeze your newborn’s credit score: This can help prevent identity theft of your newborn. You’ll want to do this for each of the three main credit bureaus, Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. Update your health insurance: Make sure to add your newborn to your health insurance. Some parents may also wish to change to a plan with a lower deductible to help minimize risk. Research tax benefits: A quick scroll on Instagram will reveal tips for structuring your finances to accrue tax benefits with kids. You’ll want to look into some of these, among others: the Child Tax Credit and Child and Dependent Care Credit. Update your budget: A newborn baby can be a shock to your finances. Here are some common expenses to consider when updating your budget: Childcare: The average cost of daycare is $321/week. The average cost of a full-time nanny is $766/week. So it’s a good idea to call child care centers in your area to get a sense of what you’ll need—and how far out to reserve your spot. Daily newborn items: Diapers, wipes, formulas, bottles, clothes, toys, medicine, books—the list goes on. Healthcare: Depending on your health insurance, you’ll likely be paying more each paycheck. Rent or mortgage: Maybe you need more space, or are considering a renovation—or even a move to be closer to family. Discretionary spending: You may need to temporarily cut back on things like shopping, vacation, and dining out (probably not a problem with a newborn anyway) to make room for your newborn expenses. Increase your emergency fund: Once you’ve updated your budget and have a handle on your fixed monthly expenses, you will likely need to top up your emergency fund in order to still cover three to six months of expenses. There’s a lot to consider when preparing for your newborn and their short-term and long-term needs. And of course, each family is different. What type of school your kiddos attend, when you start saving, and where you live will all play a role in the decisions you make. But, as with saving for most things: Starting early can help you set your family up with a firm financial foundation that grows with your evolving needs.

                                 <p class="item-title">Your retirement income shouldn’t be a guessing game</p>
                                 <div class="js-post-body-count" aria-hidden="true" hidden="">
                                    Your retirement income shouldn’t be a guessing game  So we built a dynamic safe withdrawal tool to help take the guesswork out of it The thought of running out of money in retirement can be scary, and it begs a common question: How much can I safely withdraw in retirement? The 4% rule has dominated the conversation here, due in large part to its simplicity. The idea: spend up to 4% of your retirement savings each year, and your money will most likely last 30 years. It’s a helpful shorthand early on, but the closer you get to retirement, the more nuance matters. Because the truth is there is no one single safe withdrawal rate. Yours will change year to year depending on a few variables, including: Market conditions (see: the retirement Class of ‘08) Inflation (see: recent times) How long you expect to live If all of this sounds maddeningly inconclusive, we agree. So we designed a dynamic safe withdrawal strategy and built the tool right into the Crestwood Capital Management app. All so you can spend with peace of mind. How Crestwood Capital Management handles safe withdrawals If you're a Crestwood Capital Management customer, you’re probably familiar with Goal Forecaster. It's one of the most helpful tools we have in charting a path to retirement. Once you're in retirement, we shift Goal Forecaster in reverse. Instead of projecting how your savings may stack up over the years, we project different scenarios for spending them down in retirement. Want to see for yourself? Create a new Retirement Income goal (Add new &gt; IRA &gt; Create new Retirement Income goal) and find the tool under "Projections." Enter how much you have in retirement savings, then we'll serve up a personalized projection for a safe monthly withdrawal. We auto-fill a life expectancy age, but you can tinker with this number too. When the time comes to retire and start putting your hard-earned savings to use, we suggest reviewing your safe withdrawal rate annually, and working with both a tax and financial advisor to fine-tune a spending plan for your specific situation. Assuming your retirement savings are spread across taxable, tax-deferred, and tax-exempt accounts, the ideal withdrawal order between all of them will depend on a few variables. Before you go any further, however, it's worth reflecting on a final question. What does "safe" mean to you? "Die with Zero" makes for a provocative book title, but we don’t recommend taking it literally. So while most safe withdrawal strategies (including ours) define "safe" as simply not running out of money, you, a totally reasonable human being, might want to raise the bar slightly higher. Maybe you'd rather not cut things so close at the end. Maybe you'd like to leave some of your wealth to family or charity. Whatever your reasons, they’re valid. Just know you'll need to adjust your withdrawals accordingly. So play around with our projections. Sit with a few different end-of-life scenarios, until you land on a number you can live with. Then spend away, and start realizing the retirement of your dreams.

                                 <p class="item-title">How to talk money with your aging parents</p>
                                 <div class="js-post-body-count" aria-hidden="true" hidden="">
                                    How to talk money with your aging parents  Talking about their financial future isn’t easy, but it’s important Talking money with your parents is no one’s idea of a good time. But as you enter middle age, and they enter their Golden years, it’s important to create an open dialogue. Because one day, you could be pressed into duty helping them manage their finances, or even stepping in with financial support yourself. Pew Research Center polled adults with an aging (65+) parent and found it’s more common than you might think. So before you buy another bouquet of flowers, or another tacky tie, consider gifting your parents an awkward but meaningful conversation on money’s role in aging with grace. Here's how. Step into their shoes, then switch mindsets If you think it's hard having this “talk” with your parents, imagine how they must feel. Maybe they're afraid their money won't last. Maybe they're too embarrassed to ask for help. From anyone, let alone someone whose diaper they once changed (and changed, and changed). This sort of empathy sets the stage for a true heart-to-heart. Sure, you could share any number of practical tips—everything from catch-up contributions and safe withdrawal strategies to (quick plug) how awesome Crestwood Capital Management is and how easy it is to switch—but those conversations are best left for another day. What matters most in these first few exchanges is to build trust, and to come at things through the lens of curiosity, not problem-solving. To that end, we leave you with a few suggestions. Three ways to set the table, and three icebreaker ideas Depending on your relationship with your parents, there may be no way around this: It will be awkward. Your inquiries may be met with resistance. So start getting comfortable with both possibilities. A few tips can help your odds: Pick a boring time. Steer clear of hectic holidays. Start small. Spread things out over multiple conversations. Stay curious. The questions matter more than the answers. Now, once it’s time to actually start the conversation, consider a few icebreakers: The “23andMe” angle. “I’m curious, how did your parents handle their finances as they aged? Did you ever talk about it with them?” The “I’ll go first” angle. “With the kids getting older, I’ve been thinking more and more about estate planning lately. But it’s all so overwhelming.” The CNBC angle. “Did you see the Dow just dropped [insert number] points? I know it’s easy to overreact, but it stings seeing my portfolio shrink even just a little.” Regardless of where things go from here, remember to give yourself credit. You just took the hardest step (the first one) in joining your parents on their financial journey. And if there ever does come a day when they consider joining you at Betterment, our team is here to help.

                                 How Crestwood Capital Management Manages Risks in Your Portfolio true Crestwood Capital Management's tools can keep you on track with the best chance of reaching your goals. Investing always involves some level of risk. But you should always have control over how much risk you take on. When your goals are decades away, it's easier to invest in riskier assets. The closer you get to reaching your goals, the more you may want to play it safe. Crestwood Capital Management's tools can help manage risk and keep you on track toward your goals. In this guide, we’ll: Explain how Crestwood Capital Management provides allocation advice Talk about determining your personal risk level Walk through some of Crestwood Capital Management's automated tools that help you manage risk Take a look at low-risk portfolios The key to managing your risk: asset allocation Risk is inherent to investing, and to some degree risk is good. High risk, high reward, right? What’s important is how you manage your risk. You want your investments to grow as the market fluctuates. One major way investors manage risk is through diversification. You’ve likely heard the old cliche, “Don’t put all your eggs in one basket.” This is the same reasoning investors use. We diversify our investments, putting our eggs in various baskets, so to speak. This way if one investment fails, we don’t lose everything. But how do you choose which baskets to put your eggs in? And how many eggs do you put in those baskets? Investors have a name for this process: asset allocation. Asset allocation involves splitting up your investment dollars across several types of financial assets (like stocks and bonds). Together these investments form your portfolio. A good portfolio will have your investment dollars in the right baskets: protecting you from extreme loss when the markets perform poorly, yet leaving you open to windfalls when the market does well. If that sounds complicated, there’s good news: Crestwood Capital Management will automatically recommend how to allocate your investments based on your individual goals. How Crestwood Capital Management provides allocation advice At Betterment, our recommendations start with your financial goals. Each of your financial goals—whether it’s a vacation or retirement—gets its own allocation of stocks and bonds. Next we look at your investment horizon, a fancy term for “when you need the money and how you’ll withdraw it.” It’s like a timeline. How long will you invest for? Will you take it out all at once, or a little bit at a time? For a down payment goal, you might withdraw the entire investment after 10 years once you’ve hit your savings mark. But when you retire, you’ll probably withdraw from your retirement account gradually over the course of years. What if you don’t have a defined goal? If you’re investing without a timeline or target amount, we’ll use your age to set your investment horizon with a default target date of your 65th birthday. We’ll assume you’ll withdraw from it like a retirement account, but maintain a slightly riskier portfolio even when you hit the target date, since you haven’t decided when you'll liquidate those investments. But you’re not a “default” person. So why would you want a default investment plan? That’s why you should have a goal. When we know your goal and time horizon, we can determine the best risk level by assessing possible outcomes across a range of bad to average markets. Our projection model includes many possible futures, weighted by how likely we believe each to be. By some standards, we err on the side of caution with a fairly conservative allocation model. Our mission is to help you get to your goal through steady saving and appropriate allocation, rather than taking on unnecessary risk. How much risk should you take on? Your investment horizon is one of the most important factors in determining your risk level. The more time you have to reach your investing goals, the more risk you can afford to safely take. So generally speaking, the closer you are to reaching your goal, the less risk your portfolio should be exposed to. This is why we use the Crestwood Capital Management auto-adjust—a glide path (aka formula) used for asset allocation that becomes more conservative as your target date approaches. We adjust the recommended allocation and portfolio weights of the glide path based on your specific goal and time horizon. Want to take a more aggressive approach? More conservative? That’s totally ok. You’re in control. You always have the final say on your allocation, and we can show you the likely outcomes. Our quantitative approach helps us establish a set of recommended risk ranges based on your goals. If you choose to deviate from our risk guidance, we’ll provide you with feedback on the potential implications. Take more risk than we recommend, and we’ll tell you we believe your approach is “too aggressive” given your goal and time horizon. Even if you care about the downsides less than the average outcome, we’ll still caution you against taking on more risk, because it can be very difficult to recover from losses in a portfolio flagged as “too aggressive.” On the other hand, if you choose a lower risk level than our “conservative” band, we'll label your choice “very conservative.” A downside to taking a lower risk level is you may need to save more. You should choose a level of risk that’s aligned with your ability to stay the course. An allocation is only optimal if you’re able to commit to it in both good markets and bad ones. To ensure you’re comfortable with the short-term risk in your portfolio, we present both extremely good and extremely poor return scenarios for your selection over a one-year period. How Crestwood Capital Management automatically optimizes your risk An advantage of investing with Crestwood Capital Management is that our technology works behind the scenes to automatically manage your risk in a variety of ways, including auto-adjusted allocation and rebalancing. Auto-adjusted allocation For most goals, the ideal allocation will change as you near your goal. We use automation to make those adjustments as efficient and tax-friendly as possible. Deposits, withdrawals, and dividends can help us guide your portfolio toward the target allocation, without having to sell any assets. If we do need to sell any of your investments, our tax-smart technology minimizes the potential tax impact. First we look for shares that have losses. These can offset other taxes. Then we sell shares with the smallest embedded gains (and smallest potential taxes). Crestwood Capital Management's auto-adjusted allocation not only saves you time, but it also gives you a smooth, tax-efficient path from higher risk to lower risk. Rebalancing Over time, individual assets in a diversified portfolio move up and down in value, drifting away from the target weights that help achieve proper diversification. The difference between your target allocation and the actual weights in your current ETF portfolio is called portfolio drift. We define portfolio drift as the total absolute deviation of each super asset class from its target, divided by two. These super asset classes are US Bonds, International Bonds, Emerging Markets Bonds, US Stocks, International Stocks, and Emerging Markets Stocks. A high drift may expose you to more (or less) risk than you intended when you set the target allocation. Crestwood Capital Management automatically monitors your account for rebalancing opportunities to reduce drift, although rebalancing will likely not occur at a lower account balance. There are several different methods depending on the circumstances: Cash flow rebalancing generally occurs when cash flows going into or out of the portfolio are already happening. We use inflows (like deposits and dividend reinvestments) to buy asset classes that are under-weight. This reduces the need to sell, which in turn reduces capital gains taxes. And we use outflows (like withdrawals) by seeking to first sell asset classes that are overweight. Sell/buy rebalancing reshuffles assets that are already in the portfolio. When cash flows can’t keep your ETF portfolio’s drift within 3% percentage points (or 5% percentage points for portfolios that contain mutual funds and 7% for portfolios with crypto ETFs), we try to sell just enough of overweight super asset classes to buy into underweight super asset classes and reduce the drift to zero. These super asset classes are US Bonds, International Bonds, Emerging Markets Bonds, US Stocks, International Stocks, and Emerging Markets Stocks. A couple exceptions exist, and those are when we attempt to avoid realizing short term capital gains within taxable accounts or wash sales. Allocation change rebalancing occurs when you change your target allocation. This sells securities and could possibly realize capital gains, but we still utilize our tax minimization algorithm to help reduce the tax impact. We’ll let you know the potential tax impact before you confirm your allocation change. Once you confirm it, we’ll rebalance to your new target with minimized drift. If you are an Advised client, rebalancing in your account may function differently depending on the portfolio type your Advisor has selected for you. We recommend reaching out to your Advisor for further details. How Crestwood Capital Management reduces risk in portfolios Investments like short-term US treasuries can help reduce risk in portfolios. At a certain point, however, including assets such as these in a portfolio no longer improves returns for the amount of risk taken. For Betterment, this point is our 60% stock portfolio. Portfolios with a stock allocation of 60% or more don’t incorporate these exposures. We include our U.S. Ultra-Short Income ETF and our U.S. Short-Term Treasury Bond ETF in the portfolio at stock allocations below 60% for both the IRA and taxable versions of the Crestwood Capital Management Core portfolio strategy. If your portfolio includes no stocks (meaning you allocated 100% bonds), we can take the hint. You likely don’t want to worry about market volatility. So in that case, we recommend that you invest everything in these ETFs. At 100% bonds and 0% stocks, a Crestwood Capital Management Core portfolio consists of 60% U.S. short-term treasury bonds, 20% U.S. short-term high quality bonds, and 20% inflation protected bonds. Increase the stock allocation in your portfolio, and we’ll decrease the allocation to these exposures. Reach the 60% stock allocation threshold, and we’ll remove these funds from the recommended portfolio. At that allocation, they decrease expected returns given the desired risk of the overall portfolio. Short-term U.S. treasuries generally have lower volatility (any price swings are quite mild) and smaller drawdowns (shorter, less significant periods of loss). The same can be said for short-term high quality bonds, but they are slightly more volatile. It’s also worth noting that these asset classes don’t always go down at exactly the same time. By combining these asset classes, we’re able to produce a portfolio with a higher potential yield while maintaining relatively lower volatility. As with other assets, the returns for assets such as high quality bonds include both the possibility of price returns and income yield. Generally, price returns are expected to be minimal, with the primary form of returns coming from the income yield. The yields you receive from the ETFs in Crestwood Capital Management's 100% bond portfolio are the actual yields of the underlying assets after fees. Since we’re investing directly in funds that are paying prevailing market rates, you can feel confident that the yield you receive is fair and in line with prevailing rates.

                                 How To Plan Your Taxes When Investing true Tax planning should happen year round. Here are some smart moves to consider that can help you save money now—and for years to come. Editor’s note: We’re about to dish on taxes and investing in length, but please keep in mind Crestwood Capital Management isn’t a tax advisor, nor should any information here be considered tax advice. Please consult a tax professional for advice on your specific situation. In 1 minute No one wants to pay more taxes than they have to. But as an investor, it’s not always clear how your choices change what you may ultimately owe to the IRS. Consider these strategies that can help reduce your taxes, giving you more to spend or invest as you see fit. Max out retirement accounts: The more you invest in your IRA and/or 401(k), the more tax benefits you receive. So contribute as much as you’re able to. Consider tax loss harvesting: When your investments lose value, you have the opportunity to reduce your tax bill. Selling depreciated assets lets you deduct the loss to offset other investment gains or decrease your taxable income. You can do this for up to $3,000 worth of losses every year, and additional losses can count toward future years. Rebalance your portfolio with cash flows: To avoid realizing gains before you may need to, try to rebalance your portfolio without selling any existing investments. Instead, use cash flows, including new deposits and dividends, to adjust your portfolio’s allocation. Consider a Roth conversion: You can convert all or some of traditional IRA into a Roth IRA at any income level and at any time. You’ll pay taxes upfront, but when you retire, your withdrawals are tax free. It’s worth noting that doing so is a permanent change, and it isn’t right for everyone. We recommend consulting a qualified tax advisor before making the decision. Invest your tax refund: Tax refunds can feel like pleasant surprises, but in reality they represent a missed opportunity. In practice, they mean you’ve been overpaying Uncle Sam throughout the year, and only now are you getting your money back. If you can, make up for this lost time by investing your refund right away. Donate to charity: Giving to causes you care about provides tax benefits. Donate in the form of appreciated investments instead of cash, and your tax-deductible donation can also help you avoid paying taxes on capital gains. In 5 minutes Taxes are complicated. It’s no wonder so many people dread tax season. But if you only think about them at the start of the year or when you look at your paycheck, you could be missing out. As an investor, you can save a lot more in taxes by being strategic with your investments throughout the year. In this guide, we’ll: Explain how you can save on taxes with strategic investing Examine specific tips for tax optimization Consider streamlining the process via automation Max out retirement accounts every year Retirement accounts such as IRAs and 401(k)s come with tax benefits. The more you contribute to them, the more of those benefits you enjoy. Depending on your financial situation, it may be worth maxing them out every year. The tax advantages of 401(k)s and IRAs come in two flavors: Roth and traditional. Contributions to Roth accounts are made with post-tax dollars, meaning Uncle Sam has already taken a cut. Contributions to traditional accounts, on the other hand, are usually made with pre-tax dollars. These two options effectively determine whether you pay taxes on this money now or later. So, which is better, Roth or Traditional? The answer depends on how much money you expect to live on during retirement. If you think you’ll be in a higher tax bracket when you retire (because you’ll be withdrawing more than you currently make each month), then paying taxes now with a Roth account can keep more in your pocket. But if you expect to be in the same or lower tax bracket when you retire, then pushing your tax bill down the road via a Traditional retirement account may be the better route. Use tax loss harvesting throughout the year Some of your assets will decrease in value. That’s part of investing. But tax loss harvesting is designed to allow you to use losses in your taxable (i.e. brokerage) investing accounts to your advantage. You gain a tax deduction by selling assets at a loss. That deduction can offset other investment gains or decrease your taxable income by up to $3,000 every year. And any losses you don’t use rollover to future years. Traditionally, you’d harvest these losses at the end of the year as you finalize your deductions. But then you could miss out on other losses throughout the year. Continuously monitoring your portfolio lets you harvest losses as they happen. This could be complicated to do on your own, but automated tools make it easy. At Betterment, we offer Tax Loss Harvesting+ at no extra cost. Once you determine if Tax Loss Harvesting+ is right for you (Crestwood Capital Management will ask you a few questions to help you determine this), all you have to do is enable it, and this feature looks for opportunities regularly, seeking to help increase your after-tax returns.* Keep in mind, however, that everyone’s tax situation is different—and Tax Loss Harvesting+ may not be suitable for yours. In general, we don’t recommend it if: Your future tax bracket will be higher than your current tax bracket. You can currently realize capital gains at a 0% tax rate. You’re planning to withdraw a large portion of your taxable assets in the next 12 months. You risk causing wash sales due to having substantially identical investments elsewhere. Rebalance your portfolio with cash flows As the market ebbs and flows, your portfolio can drift from its target allocation. One way to rebalance your portfolio is by selling assets, but that can cost you in taxes. A more efficient method for rebalancing is to use cash flows like new deposits and dividends you’ve earned. This can help keep your allocation on target while keeping taxes to a minimum. Crestwood Capital Management can automate this process, automatically monitoring your portfolio for rebalancing opportunities, and efficiently rebalancing your portfolio throughout the year once your account has reached the balance threshold. Consider getting out of high-cost investments Sometimes switching to a lower-cost investment firm means having to sell investments, which can trigger taxes. But over time, high-fee investments could cost you more than you’d pay in taxes to move to a lower cost money manager. For example, if selling a fund will cost you $1,000 in taxes, but you will save $500 per year in fees, you can break even in just two years. If you plan to be invested for longer than that, switching can be a savvy investment move. Consider a Roth conversion The IRS limits who can contribute to a Roth IRA based on income. But there’s no income limit for converting your traditional IRA into a Roth IRA. It’s not for everyone, and it does come with some potential pitfalls, but you have good reasons to consider it. A Roth conversion could: Lower the taxable portion of the conversion due to after-tax contributions made previously Lower your tax rates Put you in a lower tax bracket than normal due to retirement or low-income year Provide tax-free income in retirement or for a beneficiary Provide an opportunity to use an AMT (alternative minimum tax) credit carryover Provide an opportunity to use an NOL (net operating loss) carryover If you decide to convert your IRA, don’t wait until December—you’d miss out on 11 months of potential tax-free growth. Generally, the earlier you do your conversion the better. That said, Roth conversions are permanent, so be certain about your decision before making the change. It’s worth speaking with a qualified tax advisor to determine whether a Roth conversion is right for you. Invest your tax refund It might feel nice to receive a tax refund, but it usually means you’ve been overpaying your taxes throughout the year. That’s money you could have been investing! If you get a refund, consider investing it to make up for lost time. Depending on the size of your refund, you may want to resubmit your Form W-4 to your employer to adjust the amount of taxes withheld from each future paycheck. The IRS offers a Tax Withholding Estimator to help you get your refund closer to $0. Then you could increase your 401(k) contribution by that same amount. You won’t notice a difference in your paycheck, but it can really add up in your retirement account. Donate to charity It’s often said that it’s better to give than to receive. This is doubly true when charitable giving provides tax benefits in addition to the feeling of doing good. You can optimize your taxes while supporting your community or giving to causes you care about. To donate efficiently, consider giving away appreciated investments instead of cash. Then you avoid paying taxes on capital gains, and the gift is still tax deductible. You’ll have to itemize your deductions above the standard deduction, so you may want to consider “bunching” two to five years’ worth of charitable contributions. Crestwood Capital Management's Charitable Giving can help streamline the donation process by automatically identifying the most appreciated long-term investments and partnering directly with highly-rated charities across a range of causes.

                                 How Crestwood Capital Management's tech helps you manage your money true Our human experts harness the power of technology to help you reach your financial goals. Here’s how. When you’re trying to make the most of your money and plan for the future, there are some things humans simply can’t do as well as algorithms. The big idea: Here at Betterment, we’re all about automated investing—using technology with human experts at the helm—to manage your money smarter and help you meet your financial goals. How does it work? Robo-advisors use algorithms and automation to optimize your investments faster than a human can. They do the heavy lifting behind the scenes, managing all the data analysis and adapting investment expertise to fit your circumstances. All you need to do is fill in the gaps with details about your financial goals. The result: you spend less time managing your finances and more time enjoying your life, while Crestwood Capital Management focuses on your specific reasons for saving, adjusting your risk based on your timeline and target amount. Plus, robo-advisors cost less to operate. While the specific fees vary from one robo-advisor to the next, they all tend to be a fraction of what it costs to work with a traditional investment manager, which translates to savings for you. Learn more about how much it costs to save, spend and invest with Crestwood Capital Management. A winning combination of human expertise and technology: Automation is what Crestwood Capital Management is known for. But our team of financial experts is our secret sauce. They research, prototype, and implement all the advice and activity that you see in your account. Our algorithms and tools are built on the expertise of traders, quantitative researchers, tax experts, CFP® professionals, behavioral scientists, and more. Four big benefits (just for starters): No more idle cash: We automatically reinvest dividends, even purchasing fractions of shares on your behalf, so you don’t miss out on potential market returns. A focus on the future: Nobody knows the future. And that makes financial planning tough. Your situation can change at any time but our tools and advice can help you see how various changes could affect your goals. We show you a range of potential outcomes so you can make more informed decisions. Anticipating taxes: We may not be able to predict future tax rates, but we can be pretty sure that certain incomes and account types will be subject to some taxes. This becomes especially relevant in retirement planning, where taxes affect which account types are most valuable to you. Factoring in inflation: We don’t know how inflation will change, but we can reference known historical ranges, as well as targets set by fiscal policy. The most important thing is to factor in some inflation because we know it won’t be zero. We currently assume a 2% inflation rate in our retirement planning advice and in our safe withdrawal advice, which is what the Fed currently targets. Additional advice is always available: At Betterment, we automate what we can and complement our automated advice with access to our financial planning experts through our Premium plan, which offers unlimited calls and emails with our team of CFP® professionals. You can also schedule a call with an advisor to assist with a rollover or help with your initial account setup. Whether you need a one-time consultation or ongoing support, you can always discuss your unique financial situations with one of our licensed financial professionals Managing your money with Crestwood Capital Management: Our mission is to empower you to make the most of your money, so you can live better. Sometimes the best way to do that is with human creativity and critical thought. Sometimes it’s with machine automation and precision. Usually, it takes a healthy dose of both.

                                 Three steps to size up your emergency fund true Strive for at least three months of expenses while taking these factors into consideration. Imagine losing your job, totaling your car, or landing in the hospital. How quickly would your mind turn from the shock of the event itself to worrying about paying your bills? If you’re anything like the majority of Americans recently surveyed by Bankrate, finances would add insult to injury pretty fast: 57% | Percentage of U.S. adults currently unable to afford a $1,000 emergency expense In these scenarios, an emergency fund can not only help you avoid taking on high-interest debt or backtracking on other money goals, it can give you one less thing to worry about in trying times. So how much should you have saved, and where should you put it? Follow these three steps. 1. Tally up your monthly living expenses — or use our shortcut. Coming up with this number isn’t always easy. You may have dozens of regular expenses falling into one of a few big buckets: Food Housing Transportation Medical When you create an Emergency Fund goal at Betterment, we automatically estimate your monthly expenses based on two factors from your financial profile: Your self-reported household annual income Your zip code’s estimated cost of living You’re more than welcome to use your own dollar figure, but don’t let math get in the way of getting started. 2. Decide how many months make sense for you We recommend having at least three months’ worth of expenses in your emergency fund. A few scenarios that might warrant saving more include: You support others with your income Your job security is iffy You don’t have steady income You have a serious medical condition But it really comes down to how much will help you sleep soundly at night. According to Bankrate’s survey, nearly ⅔ of people say that total is six months or more. Whatever amount you land on, we’ll suggest a monthly recurring deposit to help you get there. We’ll also project a four-year balance based on your initial and scheduled deposits and your expected return and volatility. Why four years? We believe that’s a realistic timeframe to save at least three months of living expenses through recurring deposits. If you can get there quicker and move on to other money goals, even better! 3. Pick a place to keep your emergency fund We recommend keeping your emergency fund in one of two places: cash—more specifically a low-risk, high-yield cash account—or a bond-heavy investing account. A low-risk, high-yield cash account like our Cash Reserve may not always keep pace with inflation, but it comes with no investment risk. An investing account is better suited to keep up with inflation but is relatively riskier. Because of this volatility, we currently suggest adding a 30% buffer to your emergency fund’s target amount if you stick with the default stock/bond allocation. There also may be tax implications should you withdraw funds. Your decision will again come down to your comfort level with risk. If the thought of seeing your emergency fund’s value dip, even for a second, gives you heartburn, you might consider sticking with a cash account. Or you can always hedge and split your emergency fund between the two. There’s no wrong answer here! Remember to go with the (cash) flow There’s no final answer here either. Emergency funds naturally ebb and flow over the years. Your monthly expenses could go up or down. You might have to withdraw (and later replace) funds. Or you simply might realize you need a little more saved to feel secure. Revisit your numbers on occasion—say, once a year or anytime you get a raise or big new expense like a house or baby—and rest easy knowing you’re tackling one of the most important financial goals out there.
