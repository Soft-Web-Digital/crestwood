                              How to turn your retirement savings into retirement income true An income strategy during retirement can help make your portfolio last longer, while also easing potential tax burdens. Retirement planning doesn’t end when you retire. To have the retirement you’ve been dreaming of, you need to ensure your savings will last. And how much you withdraw each month isn’t all that matters. In this guide we’ll cover: What a retirement income plan is How much to withdraw each year Which accounts you should withdraw from first Why changes in the market affect you differently in retirement How to handle a market downturn when you’re nearing retirement How Betterment helps take the guesswork out of your retirement income What is retirement income planning? You’ll likely spend decades saving and investing for retirement. But when that big moment comes, what happens next? If you’ve been diligently setting aside cash, you might have upwards of a million dollars to manage. That’s certainly something to be proud of: It puts you in a great position—and also comes with new responsibilities. Think of it this way: You’ve been getting a paycheck from your employer regularly for 30 to 40 years. Now you’re the one cutting those checks. So,how do you make the most of your assets? What is the best way to turn them into a stream of sustainable income that will, hopefully, last you through retirement? “Retirement income planning” is a broad phrase to help you think about how to prepare for the “spend down” years (as opposed to the “saving up” years). Financial professionals used to refer to the “three-legged stool” of retirement income planning: Social Security, a pension, and personal savings. Considering that pensions are hardly used anymore, and the future of Social Security is murky, we’re more-or-less down to one leg: personal savings. But in today’s world, personal savings can incorporate a few different cash streams – personal investment accounts, Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs), and of course – a 401(k). All of which can play a role in your retirement income plan. Why changes in the market affect you differently in retirement Stock markets can swing up or down at any time. They’re volatile. When you’re saving for a distant retirement, you usually don’t have to worry as much about temporary dips. But during retirement, market volatility can have a greater effect on your savings. An investment account is a collection of individual assets. When you make a withdrawal from your retirement account, you’re selling off assets to equal the amount you want to withdraw. So say the market is going through a temporary dip. Since you’re retired, you have to continue making withdrawals in order to maintain your income. During the dip, your investment assets may have less value, so you have to sell more of them to equal the same amount of money. When the market goes back up, you have fewer assets that benefit from the rebound. The opposite is true, too. When the market is up, you don’t have to sell as many of your assets to maintain your income. There will always be good years and bad years in the market. How your withdrawals line up with the market’s volatility is called the “sequence of returns.” Unfortunately, you can’t control it. In many ways, it’s the luck of the withdrawal. Still, there are ways to help decrease the potential impact of a bad sequence of returns. How to limit bad timing from ruining your retirement The last thing you want is to retire and then lose your savings to market volatility. Consider taking some steps to try and protect your retirement from a bad sequence of returns. Adjust your level of risk As you near or enter retirement, it’s likely time to start dialing down your stock-to-bond allocation. Invest too heavily in stocks, and your retirement savings could tank right when you need them. Betterment generally recommends turning down your ratio to about 56% stocks in early retirement, then gradually decreasing to about 30% toward the end of retirement. Rebalance your portfolio During retirement, the two most common cash flows in/out of your investment accounts will likely be dividends you earn and withdrawals you make. If you’re strategic, you can use these cash flows as opportunities to rebalance your portfolio. For example, if stocks are down at the moment, you likely want to withdraw from your bonds instead. This can help prevent you from selling stocks at a loss. Alternatively, if stocks are rallying, you may want to reinvest your dividends into bonds (instead of cashing them out) in order to bring your portfolio back into balance with your preferred ratio of stocks to bonds. Keep an emergency fund Even in retirement, it’s important to have an emergency fund. If you keep a separate account in your portfolio with enough money to cover three to six months of expenses, you can likely cushion—or ride out altogether—the blow of a bad sequence of returns. Supplement your income Hopefully, you’ll have enough retirement savings to produce a steady income from withdrawals. But it’s nice to have other income sources, too, to minimize your reliance on investment withdrawals in the first place. While there still is Social Security—it’s future is murky. Maybe you have a pension you can withdraw from, too. Or a part-time job. Or rental properties. Along with the other precautions above, these additional income sources can help counter bad returns early in retirement. While you can’t control your sequence of returns, you can control the order you withdraw from your accounts. And that’s important, too. How much should you withdraw each year Deciding how much to withdraw annually from your 401(k) once you’re retired involves balancing anticipated expenses with available savings. You’ll want to consider tax implications, market fluctuations, inflation, health/longevity, and additional income streams (more on this below). A good place to start is with the 4% rule, which entails withdrawing 4% of your retirement savings in the first year, then adjusting the amount annually for inflation. Keep in mind: the 4% rule typically assumes your portfolio is split almost evenly between stocks and bonds, and that your funds are held in a tax-deferred account, such as a traditional IRA or 401(k), where withdrawals are taxable. Although the 4% rule has been popular for decades, it's applicability has been challenged in recent years. Longer lifespans, healthcare costs, inflation rates, and additional income streams have all changed the economic landscape. Ultimately, there is no one-size-fits-all answer to how much you should withdraw annually in retirement. A financial advisor can help you create a roadmap that’s right for you in retirement. Which accounts to withdraw from first In retirement, taxes are usually one of your biggest expenses. They’re right up there with healthcare costs. When it comes to your retirement savings, there are three “tax pools” your accounts can fall under: Taxable accounts: individual accounts, joint accounts, and trusts. Tax-deferred accounts: individual retirement accounts (IRAs), 401(k)s, 403(b)s, and Thrift Savings Plans Tax-free accounts: Roth IRAs, Roth 401(k)s Each of these account types (taxable, tax-deferred, and tax-free) are taxed differently—and that’s important to understand when you start making withdrawals. When you have funds in all three tax pools, this is known as “tax diversification.” This strategy can create some unique opportunities for managing your retirement income. For example, when you withdraw from your taxable accounts, you only pay taxes on the capital gains, not the full amount you withdraw. With a tax-deferred account like a Traditional 401(k), you usually pay taxes on the full amount you withdraw, so with each withdrawal, taxes take more away from your portfolio’s future earning potential. Since you don’t have to pay taxes on withdrawals from your tax-free accounts, it’s typically best to save these for last. You want as much tax-free money as possible, right? So, while we’re not a tax advisor, and none of this information should be considered advice for your specific situation, the ideal withdrawal order generally-speaking is: Taxable accounts Tax-deferred accounts Tax-free accounts But there are a few exceptions. Incorporating minimum distributions Once you reach a certain age, you must generally begin taking required minimum distributions (RMDs) from your tax-deferred accounts. Failure to do so results in a steep penalty on the amount you were supposed to take. This changes things—but only slightly. At this point, you may want to consider following a new order: Withdraw your RMDs. If you still need more, then pull from taxable accounts. When there’s nothing left in those, start withdrawing from your tax-deferred accounts. Pull money from tax-free accounts. Smoothing out bumps in your tax bracket In retirement, you’ll likely have multiple sources of non-investment income, coming from Social Security, defined benefit pensions, rental income, part-time work, and/or RMDs. Since these income streams vary from year to year, your tax bracket may fluctuate throughout retirement. With a little extra planning, you can sometimes use these fluctuations to your advantage. For years where you’re in a lower bracket than usual–say, if you’re retiring before you plan on claiming Social Security benefits–it may make sense to fill these low brackets with withdrawals from tax-deferred accounts before touching your taxable accounts, and possibly consider Roth conversions. For years where you’re in a higher tax bracket, like if you sell a home and end up with large capital gains–it may make sense to pull from tax-free accounts first to minimize the effect of higher tax rates. Remember, higher taxes mean larger withdrawals and less money staying invested.

                                    How to invest during market highs Betterment experts weigh in on how to override anxiety, and be invested when the market climbs. While we invest for our own reasons, we get into the market to take advantage of potential price appreciation and income produced by financial assets. But anxiety can get the best of even the most eager investors. What if I buy when the market peaks, and then immediately declines? Sound familiar? As any investor knows, psychological aspects can cloud one’s judgment when it comes to money. We’re encouraged to minimize risk and maximize returns, whenever possible. So, a market that’s going up-up-up, can leave some investors feeling hesitant about paying premium prices—instead of opting for undervalued stocks, or lower price points. So how do we override the Fear of Purchasing at All-time Highs (or FOPAH, for short)? Is it best to dive in, or wait for a potential pullback? Our investment experts believe one of the best things you can do is face your fear, wading into the market. In practice, it can take a long time before that pullback comes, during which there may be further positive market returns. For instance, between 2012 and 2017, the S&amp;P 500 did not experience a pullback greater than 12%. Oftentimes when a pullback does arrive, it’s not heralded as a positive outcome—but an ominous event, accompanied by scary headlines that spark new fears of further downturn. This can all lead to additional hesitancy around buying stocks. While there's no "perfect" time to invest, we can still be confident that choosing a diversified portfolio of investments is a smart way to help achieve long-term financial goals. To ease your fears, work out approximately how much time you’ll need to save up for your own goals. Long-term goals, like saving for college or a deposit on a house, can take time. And that’s a good thing! The longer your time horizon (the period of time you plan to keep your savings invested in the market), the more confident you can be that your money will grow by the point you want to withdraw it. Even if the market has already recently run up when you go to invest, a prolonged time horizon should help quell a pullback in the nearterm. Despite volatility, the stock market tends to trend upwards over longer periods. By maintaining a long-term perspective, you can position yourself to benefit from the market's long-term growth potential, which can outweigh short-term losses. Dating back to 1988, if you decided to invest on any given trading day, 65% of those days would have resulted in a positive investment return over the following month. The share of days with positive returns goes up as that trailing holding period extends. Historically, no matter when an investment was made between 1988 and 2009, the market was higher 100% the time just 15 years later. Short-term goals, like saving for a vacation or a home reno, have a shorter time horizon—meaning your money has less time to grow in the market. However, it's worth remembering that historically, investing at all-time highs has not resulted in lower future returns compared to investing on any other given day. After the S&amp;P 500 reaches an all-time high, average returns tend to be slightly higher than during periods when the index has not soared so high. Practical steps to help ease your anxiety: Set up recurring deposits: When you commit to investing a fixed amount of money at set intervals over time, your losses could potentially be smaller if the market does dive in the near term. Plus, you will still have cash ready to buy at lower prices. While this comes with the risk of later buying at higher prices, it can help override the emotional pressure of trying to time the market. Diversify: Consider adding other asset classes, regions, and company sizes in your portfolio (as we do at Betterment). Our automated portfolio rebalancing is designed to maintain your investment portfolio's target asset allocation over time. Betterment continuously monitors your portfolio to see if the current allocation deviates from your target allocation—due to market fluctuations or changes in the value of your investments. Our auto-adjust feature can also help right-size the risk level of your portfolio by reducing the share of the portfolio allocated to more volatile stocks, and increasing the share allocated to bonds as your time horizon shortens.

                                    How an IRA can fit into your retirement strategy You already have access to a Betterment 401(k) through your employer. But if you’re not sure what the difference is between your 401(k) and IRA, we’ll lay it all out for you here. An Individual Retirement Account (IRA) is a type of investment account with tax advantages that helps you prepare for retirement. Depending on the type of IRA you invest in, you can make tax-free withdrawals when you retire, earn tax-free interest, or put off paying taxes until retirement. The sooner you start investing in an IRA, the more time you have for the earnings on your investment to compound before you reach retirement age. If you’re planning for retirement, it’s important to understand your options and learn how to maximize your tax benefits. Your employer already offers a 401(k) through Betterment—nice! But you may also want to have an IRA too, for a more robust plan. In this article, we’ll walk you through: What makes an IRA different from a 401(k) The types of IRAs How to choose between a Roth IRA and a Traditional IRA Timing your IRA contributions IRA recharacterizations Roth IRA conversions Let’s start by looking at what makes an Individual Retirement Account different from a 401(k). How is an IRA different from a 401(k)? When it comes to retirement planning, the two most common investment accounts people talk about are IRAs and 401(k)s. 401(k)s offer similar tax advantages to IRAs, but just about anyone can open an IRA. A 401(k) is what’s known as an employer-sponsored retirement plan: It’s only available through an employer. Other differences between these two types of accounts are that: Employers may offer a matching contribution into your 401(k) account, based on what you contribute 401(k) contributions come right out of your paycheck 401(k) contribution limits are significantly higher If your employer matches contributions to a 401(k), they’re basically giving you free money you wouldn’t otherwise receive. It’s typically wise to take advantage of this match before looking to an IRA. With an IRA, you determine exactly when and how to make contributions. You can put money into an IRA at any time over the course of the year, whereas a 401(k) almost always has to come from your paycheck. Note that annual IRA contributions can be made up until that year’s tax filing deadline, whereas the contribution deadline for 401(k)s is at the end of each calendar year. Every year, you’re only allowed to put a fixed amount of money into a retirement account, and the exact amount often changes year-to-year. For an IRA, the contribution limit for 2024 is $7,000 if you’re under 50, or $8,000 if you’re 50 or older. For a 401(k), the contribution limit for 2024 is $23,000 if you’re under 50, or $30,500 if you’re 50 or older. These contribution limits are separate, so it’s not uncommon for investors to have both a 401(k) and an IRA. What are the types of IRAs? The challenge for most people looking into IRAs is understanding which kind of IRA is most advantageous for them. For many, this boils down to Roth and/or Traditional. The advantages of each can shift over time as tax laws and your income level changes, so this is a common question for even advanced investors. As a side note, there are other IRA options suited for the self-employed or small business owner, such as the SEP IRA, but we won’t go into those here. As mentioned in the section above, IRA contributions are not made directly from your paycheck. That means that the money you are contributing to an IRA has already been taxed. When you contribute to a Traditional IRA, your contribution may be tax-deductible. Whether you are eligible to take a full, partial, or any deduction at all depends on if you or your spouse is covered by an employer retirement plan (i.e. a 401(k)) and your income level (more on these limitations later). Once funds are in your Traditional IRA, you will not pay any income taxes on investment earnings until you begin to withdraw from the account. This means that you benefit from “tax-deferred” growth. If you were able to deduct your contributions, you will pay income tax on the contributions as well as earnings at the time of withdrawal. If you were not eligible to take a deduction on your contributions, then you generally will only pay taxes on the earnings at the time of withdrawal. This is done on a “pro-rata” basis. Comparatively, contributions to a Roth IRA are not tax deductible. When it comes time to withdraw from your Roth IRA in retirement, your withdrawals will generally be tax free—even the interest you’ve accumulated. How to choose between a Roth IRA and a Traditional IRA For most people, choosing an IRA is a matter of deciding between a Roth IRA and a Traditional IRA. Neither option is inherently better: it depends on your income and your tax bracket now—and in retirement. Your income determines whether you can contribute to a Roth IRA, and also whether you are eligible to deduct contributions made to a Traditional IRA. However, the IRS doesn’t use your gross income; they look at your modified adjusted gross income, which can be different from taxable income. With Roth IRAs, your ability to contribute is phased out when your modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) reaches a certain level. If you’re eligible for both types of IRAs, the choice often comes down to what tax bracket you’re in now, and what tax bracket you think you’ll be in when you retire. If you think you’ll be in a lower tax bracket when you retire, postponing taxes with a Traditional IRA will likely result in you keeping more of your money. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket when you retire, using a Roth IRA to pay taxes now may be the better choice. The best type of account for you may change over time, but making a choice now doesn’t lock you into one option forever. So as you start retirement planning, focus on where you are now and where you’d like to be then. It’s healthy to re-evaluate your position periodically, especially when you go through major financial transitions such as getting a new job, losing a job, receiving a promotion, or creating an additional revenue stream. Timing IRA contributions: Why earlier is better Regardless of which type of IRA you select, it helps to understand how the timing of your contributions impacts your investment returns. It’s your choice to either make a maximum contribution early in the year, contribute over time, or wait until the deadline. By timing your contribution to be as early as possible, you can maximize your time in the market, which could help you achieve greater returns over time. Consider the difference between making a maximum contribution on January 1 and making it on December 1 each year. Then suppose, hypothetically, that your annual growth rate is 10%. Here’s what the difference could look like between an IRA with early contributions and an IRA with late contributions: This figure represents the scenarios mentioned above.‘Deposit Early’ indicates depositing $6,000 on January 1 of each calendar year, whereas ‘Deposit Late’ indicates depositing $6,000 on December 1 of the same calendar year, both every year for a ten-year period. Calculations assume a hypothetical growth rate of 10% annually. The hypothetical growth rate is not based on, and should not be interpreted to reflect, any Betterment portfolio, or any other investment or portfolio, and is purely an arbitrary number. Further, the results are solely based on the calculations mentioned in the preceding sentences. These figures do not take into account any dividend reinvestment, taxes, market changes, or any fees charged. The illustration does not reflect the chance for loss or gain, and actual returns can vary from those above. What’s an IRA recharacterization? You might contribute to an IRA before you have started filing your taxes and may not know exactly what your Modified Adjusted Gross Income will be for that year. Therefore, you may not know whether you will be eligible to contribute to a Roth IRA, or if you will be able to deduct your contributions to a Traditional IRA. In some cases, the IRS allows you to reclassify your IRA contributions. A recharacterization changes your contributions (plus the gains or minus the losses attributed to them) from a Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA, or, from a Roth IRA to a Traditional IRA. It’s most common to recharacterize a Roth IRA to a Traditional IRA. Generally, there are no taxes associated with a recharacterization if the amount you recharacterize includes gains or excludes dollars lost. Here are three instances where a recharacterization may be right for you: If you made a Roth contribution during the year but discovered later that your income was high enough to reduce the amount you were allowed to contribute—or prohibit you from contributing at all. If you contributed to a Traditional IRA because you thought your income would be above the allowed limits for a Roth IRA contribution, but your income ended up lower than you’d expected. If you contributed to a Roth IRA, but while preparing your tax return, you realize that you’d benefit more from the immediate tax deduction a Traditional IRA contribution would potentially provide. Additionally, we have listed a few methods that can be used to correct an over-contribution to an IRA in this FAQ resource. You cannot recharacterize an amount that’s more than your allowable maximum annual contribution. You have until each year’s tax filing deadline to recharacterize—unless you file for an extension or you file an amended tax return. What’s a Roth conversion? A Roth conversion is a one-way street. It’s a potentially taxable event where funds are transferred from a Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA. There is no such thing as a Roth to Traditional conversion. It is different from a recharacterization because you are not changing the type of IRA that you contributed to for that particular year. There is no cap on the amount that’s eligible to be converted, so the sky’s the limit for those that choose to convert. We go into Roth conversions in more detail in our Help Center. So what’s right for you? Since your employer offers a 401(k) through Betterment, it’s typically best to start there. Some employers auto-enroll new hires, meaning that paycheck contributions start automatically. Whether your employer auto-enrolls or not, you’ll need to start by claiming your 401(k) account. Once you claim your account, you can set or adjust the contribution rate. Get started here: betterment.com/accountaccess. After you’ve got your 401(k) up and running, you might want to consider contributing to an IRA as well. On your dashboard, select “Add new” in the left-hand navigation, then choose: IRA. Follow the prompts to select which type of IRA you want, and sync a bank account to contribute from. You’ll have access to the same investment options available in your 401(k). Retirement can feel hard to plan for, but Betterment has plenty of investing options to make it easy to save for. We’re here to help you work towards for the retirement of your dreams.

                                    Get to know your portfolio options Betterment helps take the stress out of investing with a range of expert-built portfolio options, made of generally low-cost ETFs (exchange-traded funds). Given the breadth of available choices, it’s natural to wonder which portfolio is right for your financial situation. The good news is each option has been designed to help investors, like you, reach their financial goals. While all of our portfolios combining stocks and bonds possess similar expected risk and return profiles, Betterment will recommend an investment allocation for you, based on the time horizon and goal type you select. You can also adjust your diversification and risk preferences. For most portfolios that hold both stocks and bonds, our “auto-adjust” feature systematically glides your portfolio(s) to a lower overall risk level as you get closer to, enter, and progress through retirement. This feature is very similar to a “glidepath,” which is found in target-date funds (TDFs). It’s great for those that want to “set it, and forget it.” With that, let’s review your portfolio options. Core Well-diversified, low-cost, and built for long-term investing, the Core portfolio features a broad collection of ETFs made of thousands of stocks and bonds from around the world. This is the default investment option for those who do not specify a portfolio strategy. Innovative Technology A well-diversified portfolio allocated similarly to the Core portfolio, but with a subset of stocks allocated to high-growth potential companies such as clean energy, semiconductors, robots, virtual reality, blockchain, and nanotechnology. This comes with increased exposure to risk. Value Tilt A well-diversified portfolio allocated similarly to the Core portfolio, but with a subset of the stocks allocation focused on potentially undervalued U.S. companies, according to certain financial metrics. Broad Impact A well-diversified portfolio that invests in companies that rank highly on environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) criteria. Climate Impact A well-diversified portfolio that invests in companies working to lower carbon emissions, fund green projects, and divest from holders of fossil fuel reserves—while still designed for potential long-term growth. Social Impact A well-diversified portfolio that invests in companies actively working toward minority empowerment and gender diversity as part of its long-term strategy. Goldman Sachs Smart Beta Targets companies that have potential to outperform the broader market over the long term. Diverse and relatively low-cost, this portfolio comes with higher exposure to risk. BlackRock Target Income A 100% bond portfolio with different income yields to help protect you against stock market volatility. This portfolio option is more suitable for investors with shorter time horizons, or for those that are seeking to generate income. Flexible portfolio A Flexible portfolio gives you more control over your investments, and allows you to modify the individual asset class weights to best fit your preferences. We’ll provide guidance on the risk exposure and diversification of your portfolio, based on your adjustments. See when using a Flexible portfolio might be right for you. After you make a portfolio selection, Betterment will handle the rest. Here are some things to keep in mind: All portfolios benefit from auto-rebalancing, which returns the value of all allocated funds back to the target weight (after the portfolio drifts with market movements). Rebalancing may be subject to a drift threshold and account balance minimum. Although changing a portfolio’s asset allocation and fund selection can cause changes in the portfolio’s performance, Betterment has designed each portfolio to be suitable in terms of its riskiness and return potential for a given time horizon and level of risk. Which is to say, you should feel comfortable choosing a portfolio based on your convictions and values. If you’re uncertain where to start, the Betterment Core portfolio is a great way to go—and it is the portfolio used by the majority of Betterment users. Keep in mind: As your investment fiduciary, Betterment monitors market action and portfolio performance, and will periodically update asset allocation or include more cost-efficient underlying funds to help optimize your portfolio performance. We’re here to help you make decisions that bring your goals into focus, and be invested in your future.

                                    When’s the best time to invest for retirement? Now.  Should you start saving for retirement? Unless you are on one of those richest-people-in-the-world lists - then the answer is, most likely, yes. From paying the rent or mortgage, credit card bills, student loans, daily living expenses - there are a lot of things competing for your money’s attention! The idea of saving for retirement can easily be pushed to the backburner for all of those other - completely understandable! - reasons. But we’re here to say - hold the phone. Even a little bit into a 401(k) can make a huge difference for your retirement. Rock and roll When a rock rolls down a hill, it goes faster and faster on its way down. It has something to do with momentum and physics – we’re not scientists here, we’re investment professionals. But the same concept applies to your 401(k) - not because of physics, but because of compounding interest. Compounding interest means that not only are your original dollars growing based on potential stock market gains, but that newly earned money also grows whenever the stock market goes up! Give compounding time to shine If the magic of compounding interest isn’t enough to get you going right away, there is one other factor to consider. If someone starts saving 6% of their paycheck at age 25, they are expected to end up with more money at age 65 than someone who contributes 10% starting at age 40. And here’s the real kicker - the person who’s doing 10% starting at age 40 will put in more of their own dollars, and is still expected to end up with less by the time they reach age 65. How is that possible? The 6% contributions had more time to grow – more time to roll down that hill gathering speed – or in this case – money. If you already have an account, log in today to view your contribution rate and consider giving it a bump – even a 1% increase can make a difference in your retirement years!

                                    Getting started with your Betterment 401(k)  Your employer chose Betterment as its 401(k) provider - so come on in and be invested for your future. Traveling around the world. Taking up a new hobby. Spending more time with family and friends. Whatever your retirement dreams are, a 401(k) can help you make them a reality. And luckily for you, your employer chose Betterment to manage its 401(k) plan. Top 3 perks of a 401(k) Participating in your employer’s 401(k) plan is a good idea for many reasons – here are the top three. With a 401(k), you can: Contribute via convenient, automatic payroll deductions (one less thing to think about!). Save on taxes, whether those savings happen today with a traditional 401(k) or at retirement with a Roth 401(k) (and the cool thing is that you can use both!). Invest more than with other retirement vehicles (individual retirement accounts (IRAs) have lower caps on how much you can put in). All said, saving for retirement with a 401(k) is basically a no-brainer. Without a regular paycheck in retirement, you’re going to rely on your own savings. And we’re not talking about cash-under-the-mattress savings or even safe-in-the-bank savings - but invested savings, which is what you get with a 401(k). (Why is it so critical to invest for long-term goals, rather than simply saving money in the bank? To tackle one word: Inflation.) Top Betterment features Betterment offers several features to help you pursue your retirement goals: Goal based – Your 401(k) will automatically be a “Retirement” goal on the Betterment platform (you could add additional goals for other things if you want). Our goal-based platform looks at your timeline until retirement and the desired amount you want to save, to help you invest in an expert-built portfolio. Low cost – Our approach uses low-cost exchange-traded funds (ETFs) so more of your money stays invested in your account. High tech –Certain portfolio strategies and goal types are automatically rebalanced and adjusted over time, and our tax-smart tools are available to you at no added management fee. Personalized – Betterment helps you work towards your long- and short-term financial goals with personalized advice. It’s easy to get started Betterment will contact you via email to set up your account via a secure link that’s unique to you. If you haven’t received an invitation from us to set up your account, please contact us. Once you’ve set up your account, be sure to set a contribution rate to help you pursue your goals (although starting with anything is far better than nothing!) and you’ll want to initiate a rollover of any old 401(k)s into your new Betterment 401(k). Were you automatically enrolled in your plan? If so, you still need to set up your account with a username and password. If your employer has determined an automatic contribution rate for your organization, know that you can adjust this in your account at any time. Betterment strives to make saving and investing for retirement easy.

                                 <p class="item-title">Why diversify outside of the US?</p>
                                 <div class="js-post-body-count" aria-hidden="true" hidden="">
                                    Why diversify outside of the US?  The outperformance of US stocks in recent history has led some investors to question whether they should invest outside the US at all, yet there remains compelling reasons to diversify globally. US investors often think of the S&amp;P 500 Index (an index of the largest companies in the US by market capitalization) when referring to the performance of the stock market. This is not surprising to hear as most US based investors exhibit a “home bias”, where they focus their investing domestically and less on international. In a Vanguard 2020 study, households they surveyed had 81% of their portfolio allocations invested in the US. On top of that, US stocks have set a high bar for performance globally, outpacing the gains in stocks across Europe, Japan, and emerging markets over the last decade. It’s become natural to ask, “Can’t I get better returns just sticking with US stocks? Why would my Betterment portfolio have any allocation to companies outside of the US?” Currently, Betterment’s Core portfolio strategy in the 100% stock allocation has a target allocation of more than 40% in international equities. Below, this piece will cover reasons diversifying internationally makes sense, including: The global market portfolio is a starting point for asset allocation There’s no guarantee that US stocks will continue to outperform Diversification creates the potential for more consistent returns Investing in the global market portfolio The short answer is that Betterment constructs all of our portfolios to be representative of the makeup of global investable assets as a whole, and you’ll find that around 40% of the world’s equity assets are invested outside of the US. International investments play an important role in reducing the risk of concentration in any one particular country within your portfolio. There’s no guarantee of continued US outperformance We’ve all heard the phrase “past performance is not indicative of future results.” For instance, stocks of one region can string together multiple years of outperformance relative to others before that trend reverses and it enters a period of underperformance. The chart below illustrates this tug of war between US and international developed stocks. While the outperformance experienced by US stocks over the last decade is striking, international developed stocks dominated in the wake of the dot com bubble in the decade before that. “International stocks” is represented by the MSCI EAFE Index. “US stocks” is represented by the MSCI US Index. Past performance is not indicative of future results. You cannot invest directly in the index. Going back further into history, in the ‘80s international developed stocks actually outperformed US stocks to the same extent that US stocks have outperformed since 2009. We believe, and many on Wall Street will admit, that trying to time these cycles can be extremely difficult and a more consistent return may be achieved by holding exposure to each geographical region’s stocks over the long-term. Before US stocks’ strong run in recent history, investors may have been tempted to allocate more to emerging market stocks based on their momentum during the 2000s. Emerging market stocks had higher returns than US equities in eight of the ten years before 2011. If an investor piled into emerging market stocks in 2011 because of their decade long track record of outperformance, they would have largely missed out on the strong gains in the US over the following 10 years. There also may be reason to believe that markets outside the US have the potential to post strong gains over the next decade. Based on certain valuation metrics, US stocks appear more expensive than their global peers. For example, companies in places such as emerging markets source much of their revenue from quickly growing economies, which may enhance profitability in the future. Diversification helps avoid drawdowns and creates the potential for consistent returns International markets are not perfectly correlated with the US, meaning they do not move in lockstep. Allocating to markets around the world therefore promotes diversification, helping buffer portfolios from the heightened volatility of individual markets. The chart below ranks the returns of Betterment’s tenured Core portfolio strategy against different regions and asset classes across calendar years, illustrating diversification in action. The Core portfolio, with a 90% allocation to stocks and 10% allocation to bonds, consistently avoided losses compared to the poorest performing assets of recent history. This was also evident in 2020 where diversification provided downside protection as the US fell into a short recession and battled a pandemic. Investors focused on using the S&amp;P 500 Index to benchmark performance will highlight that the index outperformed our Core portfolio in the time periods displayed. And while the strength of the US market is undeniable, it is important to not overlook the fact that our Core portfolio still has a sizable allocation to the US. Having a strategic, well-diversified portfolio allows investors to obtain exposure to not only markets that outperform like the US, but also to international stock markets and other asset classes that can dampen the downside in years where US stocks underperform. S&amp;P 500” (US Large Caps) is represented by the S&amp;P 500 Index. “EM” (emerging markets) is represented by the MSCI Emerging Markets Index. “US Small Caps” is represented by the Russell 2000 Index. “EAFE” (international developed markets) is represented by the MSCI EAFE Index. “US REITs” is represented by the MSCI US REIT Index. “US High Yield” is represented by the Bloomberg US Corporate High Yield Index. “Global Agg bonds” is represented by the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Bond Index. “Commodities” is represented by the Bloomberg Commodity Index. “BMT Core 90/10” represents the Betterment Core Portfolio strategy in the 90% stocks/ 10% bonds taxable allocation. Performance information for the Betterment allocation is based on the time-weighted returns of Betterment taxable portfolios with primary tickers that are at the target allocation every market day (this assumes portfolios are rebalanced daily at market closing prices). Dividends are assumed to be reinvested in the fund from which the dividend was distributed. Betterment allocations reflect portfolio holdings as of periods stated and include an annual 0.25% management fee. This does not include deposits or withdrawals over the performance period. These allocations are not representative of the performance of any actual Betterment account and actual client experience may vary because of factors including, individual deposits and withdrawals, secondary tickers associated with tax loss harvesting, allowed portfolio drift, transactions that do not occur at close of day prices, and differences in holdings between IRA and taxable portfolios. Investing in securities involves risks, and there is always the potential of losing money when you invest in securities. Market conditions can and will impact performance. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Market performance information is based on the returns of indexes tracked by Betterment, using returns data from sources and time periods listed. Performance is provided for illustrative purposes to represent broad market returns for asset classes that may not be used in all Betterment portfolios. The asset class performance is not attributable to any actual Betterment portfolio nor does it reflect any specific Betterment performance. As such, it is not net of any management fees. The performance of specific funds used for each asset class in the Betterment portfolio will differ from the performance of the broad market index returns reflected here. Past performance is not indicative of future results. You cannot invest directly in the index. At Betterment, we build portfolios and provide advice on portfolio allocations that should be suitable for each investor’s risk tolerance to help them reach their investment goals. Diversifying across stock markets, whether in the US or elsewhere in the world, helps in that continuous effort. It may be tempting to chase the high returns that US stocks have posted in recent history, anticipating that the US equity market will continue to outperform, but investors should recognize that future outperformance is near impossible to predict and that they should position themselves for a wide range of possible outcomes accordingly. This is why as a foundation of Betterment’s portfolio construction process, we start with a diversified global market portfolio.

                                    Get to know your portfolio options  Betterment helps take the stress out of investing with a range of expert-built portfolio options, made of generally low-cost ETFs (exchange-traded funds). Given the breadth of available choices, it’s natural to wonder which portfolio is right for your financial situation. The good news is each option has been designed to help investors, like you, reach their financial goals. While all of our portfolios combining stocks and bonds possess similar expected risk and return profiles, Betterment will recommend an investment allocation for you, based on the time horizon and goal type you select. You can also adjust your diversification and risk preferences. For most portfolios that hold both stocks and bonds, our “auto-adjust” feature systematically glides your portfolio(s) to a lower overall risk level as you get closer to, enter, and progress through retirement. This feature is very similar to a “glidepath,” which is found in target-date funds (TDFs). It’s great for those that want to “set it, and forget it.” With that, let’s review your portfolio options. Core Well-diversified, low-cost, and built for long-term investing, the Core portfolio features a broad collection of ETFs made of thousands of stocks and bonds from around the world. This is the default investment option for those who do not specify a portfolio strategy. Innovative Technology A well-diversified portfolio allocated similarly to the Core portfolio, but with a subset of stocks allocated to high-growth potential companies such as clean energy, semiconductors, robots, virtual reality, blockchain, and nanotechnology. This comes with increased exposure to risk. Value Tilt A well-diversified portfolio allocated similarly to the Core portfolio, but with a subset of the stocks allocation focused on potentially undervalued U.S. companies, according to certain financial metrics. Broad Impact A well-diversified portfolio that invests in companies that rank highly on environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) criteria. Climate Impact A well-diversified portfolio that invests in companies working to lower carbon emissions, fund green projects, and divest from holders of fossil fuel reserves—while still designed for potential long-term growth. Social Impact A well-diversified portfolio that invests in companies actively working toward minority empowerment and gender diversity as part of its long-term strategy. Goldman Sachs Smart Beta Targets companies that have potential to outperform the broader market over the long term. Diverse and relatively low-cost, this portfolio comes with higher exposure to risk. BlackRock Target Income A 100% bond portfolio with different income yields to help protect you against stock market volatility. This portfolio option is more suitable for investors with shorter time horizons, or for those that are seeking to generate income. Flexible portfolio A Flexible portfolio gives you more control over your investments, and allows you to modify the individual asset class weights to best fit your preferences. We’ll provide guidance on the risk exposure and diversification of your portfolio, based on your adjustments. See when using a Flexible portfolio might be right for you. After you make a portfolio selection, Betterment will handle the rest. Here are some things to keep in mind: All portfolios benefit from auto-rebalancing, which returns the value of all allocated funds back to the target weight (after the portfolio drifts with market movements). Rebalancing may be subject to a drift threshold and account balance minimum. Although changing a portfolio’s asset allocation and fund selection can cause changes in the portfolio’s performance, Betterment has designed each portfolio to be suitable in terms of its riskiness and return potential for a given time horizon and level of risk. Which is to say, you should feel comfortable choosing a portfolio based on your convictions and values. If you’re uncertain where to start, the Betterment Core portfolio is a great way to go—and it is the portfolio used by the majority of Betterment users. Keep in mind: As your investment fiduciary, Betterment monitors market action and portfolio performance, and will periodically update asset allocation or include more cost-efficient underlying funds to help optimize your portfolio performance. We’re here to help you make decisions that bring your goals into focus, and be invested in your future.

                                 <p class="item-title">How to invest during market highs</p>
                                 <div class="js-post-body-count" aria-hidden="true" hidden="">
                                    How to invest during market highs  Betterment experts weigh in on how to override anxiety, and be invested when the market climbs. While we invest for our own reasons, we get into the market to take advantage of potential price appreciation and income produced by financial assets. But anxiety can get the best of even the most eager investors. What if I buy when the market peaks, and then immediately declines? Sound familiar? As any investor knows, psychological aspects can cloud one’s judgment when it comes to money. We’re encouraged to minimize risk and maximize returns, whenever possible. So, a market that’s going up-up-up, can leave some investors feeling hesitant about paying premium prices—instead of opting for undervalued stocks, or lower price points. So how do we override the Fear of Purchasing at All-time Highs (or FOPAH, for short)? Is it best to dive in, or wait for a potential pullback? Our investment experts believe one of the best things you can do is face your fear, wading into the market. In practice, it can take a long time before that pullback comes, during which there may be further positive market returns. For instance, between 2012 and 2017, the S&amp;P 500 did not experience a pullback greater than 12%. Oftentimes when a pullback does arrive, it’s not heralded as a positive outcome—but an ominous event, accompanied by scary headlines that spark new fears of further downturn. This can all lead to additional hesitancy around buying stocks. While there's no "perfect" time to invest, we can still be confident that choosing a diversified portfolio of investments is a smart way to help achieve long-term financial goals. To ease your fears, work out approximately how much time you’ll need to save up for your own goals. Long-term goals, like saving for college or a deposit on a house, can take time. And that’s a good thing! The longer your time horizon (the period of time you plan to keep your savings invested in the market), the more confident you can be that your money will grow by the point you want to withdraw it. Even if the market has already recently run up when you go to invest, a prolonged time horizon should help quell a pullback in the nearterm. Despite volatility, the stock market tends to trend upwards over longer periods. By maintaining a long-term perspective, you can position yourself to benefit from the market's long-term growth potential, which can outweigh short-term losses. Dating back to 1988, if you decided to invest on any given trading day, 65% of those days would have resulted in a positive investment return over the following month. The share of days with positive returns goes up as that trailing holding period extends. Historically, no matter when an investment was made between 1988 and 2009, the market was higher 100% the time just 15 years later. Short-term goals, like saving for a vacation or a home reno, have a shorter time horizon—meaning your money has less time to grow in the market. However, it's worth remembering that historically, investing at all-time highs has not resulted in lower future returns compared to investing on any other given day. After the S&amp;P 500 reaches an all-time high, average returns tend to be slightly higher than during periods when the index has not soared so high. Practical steps to help ease your anxiety: Set up recurring deposits: When you commit to investing a fixed amount of money at set intervals over time, your losses could potentially be smaller if the market does dive in the near term. Plus, you will still have cash ready to buy at lower prices. While this comes with the risk of later buying at higher prices, it can help override the emotional pressure of trying to time the market. Diversify: Consider adding other asset classes, regions, and company sizes in your portfolio (as we do at Betterment). Our automated portfolio rebalancing is designed to maintain your investment portfolio's target asset allocation over time. Betterment continuously monitors your portfolio to see if the current allocation deviates from your target allocation—due to market fluctuations or changes in the value of your investments. Our auto-adjust feature can also help right-size the risk level of your portfolio by reducing the share of the portfolio allocated to more volatile stocks, and increasing the share allocated to bonds as your time horizon shortens.

                                 <p class="item-title">Traditional and Roth 401(k)s</p>
                                 <div class="js-post-body-count" aria-hidden="true" hidden="">
                                    Traditional and Roth 401(k)s  Not sure what the difference is between traditional and Roth contributions for your 401(k)? We’ll explain. Ever hear the terms traditional 401(k) and Roth 401(k) thrown around and wonder – what are they? Should I be using them? Are these the keys to untold levels of wealth and financial security?! Easy does it. There are no secret weapons or silver bullets for securing a financially fit future. That said, traditional 401(k)s and Roth 401(k)s can be important tools when building your retirement strategy, so let’s make sure you know what they are. And a fun fact to know right away: you can use both. What do they have in common? A traditional 401(k) and Roth 401(k) are tax-advantaged accounts that allow you to save and invest for retirement (the tax advantages given to these types of accounts are not available in many other investing accounts). They’re available to you as a workplace benefit offered by your employer, and they’re funded with contributions from your paycheck – you set the amount, either as a dollar or a percent. The idea behind both is that they make it easier to save and invest for retirement automatically, like a built-in part of your budget. So what’s the difference? The difference is in how they are tax-advantaged. Traditional 401(k) contributions are made with pre-tax dollars, while Roth 401(k) contributions are made with after-tax dollars. Here’s an example. Let’s say you earn $40,000 a year and make contributions into a traditional 401(k). The contributions go into the account before your paycheck is taxed (“pre-tax”), lowering your taxable income. So if you save $3,000 throughout the year, you’d be paying taxes on $37,000 rather than $40,000. In addition, the money that you contribute—and any earnings—grow tax deferred until you withdraw it in retirement. At that time, your withdrawals are considered ordinary income and you’ll pay federal and possibly state taxes depending upon where you live. And, if you want to withdraw money before you turn age 59 ½, you’ll also be subject to a 10% penalty unless you qualify for an exception. If you decide to contribute to a Roth 401(k), the money is deducted from your paycheck after taxes have been taken out. So your paycheck is taxed now, reflecting your full salary of $40,000, which includes the contributions into the Roth 401(k) account. Roth 401(k) tax benefits come into play when you withdraw the money at retirement. Because you already paid taxes, you can withdraw contributions—and any earnings—tax-free if you’re age 59 ½ or older and have held your Roth 401(k) account for at least five years. Short answer: Traditional 401(k)s can lower your taxes now, but you’ll likely pay taxes when you withdraw the money at retirement. Roth 401(k)s don’t save you on taxes today, but you likely won’t have to pay taxes when you withdraw the money at retirement. Which type of account should I use? It ultimately depends on your unique financial situation and retirement goals. Betterment is not a tax advisor, and we encourage you to consult one if you want help reviewing your finances and goals. As a general rule: If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, consider contributing pre-tax dollars into a traditional 401(k) account now, and you’ll pay taxes later. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider contributing after-tax dollars into a Roth 401(k) account, and pay your taxes now. What if I’m not sure if my tax bracket will be higher or lower in the future? You’re definitely not alone! In which case, it may make sense to invest in both. You’re allowed to make contributions to both types of accounts, spreading your tax exposure around. 5% in a traditional 401(k) and 5% in a Roth 401(k) would give you a 10% total contribution rate (in line with what many experts recommend). What if I want to withdraw my money early—that is, before I turn age 59 ½? Let’s start with the Roth 401(k). Because you already paid taxes on your contributions, you can generally withdraw that portion of the money tax-free. The portion of the withdrawal that represents your contributions to the account will generally be not taxed (and not subject to the 10% penalty). The portion of the withdrawal that represents earnings will be taxable and potentially subject to the 10% penalty. Most early withdrawals from a traditional 401(k) are taxed as ordinary income plus a 10% penalty. There are some exceptions, such as permanent disability. The tax advantages and ramifications of retirement accounts can be complicated. As Betterment is not a tax advisor, we encourage you to consult one to help you make this important decision. One more fun fact - former U.S. Senator from Delaware, William Roth, is the father of after-tax retirement accounts. Enjoy sharing that little bit of trivia at your next cocktail party, on us.

                                 <p class="item-title">How an IRA can fit into your retirement strategy</p>
                                 <div class="js-post-body-count" aria-hidden="true" hidden="">
                                    How an IRA can fit into your retirement strategy  You already have access to a Betterment 401(k) through your employer. But if you’re not sure what the difference is between your 401(k) and IRA, we’ll lay it all out for you here. An Individual Retirement Account (IRA) is a type of investment account with tax advantages that helps you prepare for retirement. Depending on the type of IRA you invest in, you can make tax-free withdrawals when you retire, earn tax-free interest, or put off paying taxes until retirement. The sooner you start investing in an IRA, the more time you have for the earnings on your investment to compound before you reach retirement age. If you’re planning for retirement, it’s important to understand your options and learn how to maximize your tax benefits. Your employer already offers a 401(k) through Betterment—nice! But you may also want to have an IRA too, for a more robust plan. In this article, we’ll walk you through: What makes an IRA different from a 401(k) The types of IRAs How to choose between a Roth IRA and a Traditional IRA Timing your IRA contributions IRA recharacterizations Roth IRA conversions Let’s start by looking at what makes an Individual Retirement Account different from a 401(k). How is an IRA different from a 401(k)? When it comes to retirement planning, the two most common investment accounts people talk about are IRAs and 401(k)s. 401(k)s offer similar tax advantages to IRAs, but just about anyone can open an IRA. A 401(k) is what’s known as an employer-sponsored retirement plan: It’s only available through an employer. Other differences between these two types of accounts are that: Employers may offer a matching contribution into your 401(k) account, based on what you contribute 401(k) contributions come right out of your paycheck 401(k) contribution limits are significantly higher If your employer matches contributions to a 401(k), they’re basically giving you free money you wouldn’t otherwise receive. It’s typically wise to take advantage of this match before looking to an IRA. With an IRA, you determine exactly when and how to make contributions. You can put money into an IRA at any time over the course of the year, whereas a 401(k) almost always has to come from your paycheck. Note that annual IRA contributions can be made up until that year’s tax filing deadline, whereas the contribution deadline for 401(k)s is at the end of each calendar year. Every year, you’re only allowed to put a fixed amount of money into a retirement account, and the exact amount often changes year-to-year. For an IRA, the contribution limit for 2024 is $7,000 if you’re under 50, or $8,000 if you’re 50 or older. For a 401(k), the contribution limit for 2024 is $23,000 if you’re under 50, or $30,500 if you’re 50 or older. These contribution limits are separate, so it’s not uncommon for investors to have both a 401(k) and an IRA. What are the types of IRAs? The challenge for most people looking into IRAs is understanding which kind of IRA is most advantageous for them. For many, this boils down to Roth and/or Traditional. The advantages of each can shift over time as tax laws and your income level changes, so this is a common question for even advanced investors. As a side note, there are other IRA options suited for the self-employed or small business owner, such as the SEP IRA, but we won’t go into those here. As mentioned in the section above, IRA contributions are not made directly from your paycheck. That means that the money you are contributing to an IRA has already been taxed. When you contribute to a Traditional IRA, your contribution may be tax-deductible. Whether you are eligible to take a full, partial, or any deduction at all depends on if you or your spouse is covered by an employer retirement plan (i.e. a 401(k)) and your income level (more on these limitations later). Once funds are in your Traditional IRA, you will not pay any income taxes on investment earnings until you begin to withdraw from the account. This means that you benefit from “tax-deferred” growth. If you were able to deduct your contributions, you will pay income tax on the contributions as well as earnings at the time of withdrawal. If you were not eligible to take a deduction on your contributions, then you generally will only pay taxes on the earnings at the time of withdrawal. This is done on a “pro-rata” basis. Comparatively, contributions to a Roth IRA are not tax deductible. When it comes time to withdraw from your Roth IRA in retirement, your withdrawals will generally be tax free—even the interest you’ve accumulated. How to choose between a Roth IRA and a Traditional IRA For most people, choosing an IRA is a matter of deciding between a Roth IRA and a Traditional IRA. Neither option is inherently better: it depends on your income and your tax bracket now—and in retirement. Your income determines whether you can contribute to a Roth IRA, and also whether you are eligible to deduct contributions made to a Traditional IRA. However, the IRS doesn’t use your gross income; they look at your modified adjusted gross income, which can be different from taxable income. With Roth IRAs, your ability to contribute is phased out when your modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) reaches a certain level. If you’re eligible for both types of IRAs, the choice often comes down to what tax bracket you’re in now, and what tax bracket you think you’ll be in when you retire. If you think you’ll be in a lower tax bracket when you retire, postponing taxes with a Traditional IRA will likely result in you keeping more of your money. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket when you retire, using a Roth IRA to pay taxes now may be the better choice. The best type of account for you may change over time, but making a choice now doesn’t lock you into one option forever. So as you start retirement planning, focus on where you are now and where you’d like to be then. It’s healthy to re-evaluate your position periodically, especially when you go through major financial transitions such as getting a new job, losing a job, receiving a promotion, or creating an additional revenue stream. Timing IRA contributions: Why earlier is better Regardless of which type of IRA you select, it helps to understand how the timing of your contributions impacts your investment returns. It’s your choice to either make a maximum contribution early in the year, contribute over time, or wait until the deadline. By timing your contribution to be as early as possible, you can maximize your time in the market, which could help you achieve greater returns over time. Consider the difference between making a maximum contribution on January 1 and making it on December 1 each year. Then suppose, hypothetically, that your annual growth rate is 10%. Here’s what the difference could look like between an IRA with early contributions and an IRA with late contributions: This figure represents the scenarios mentioned above.‘Deposit Early’ indicates depositing $6,000 on January 1 of each calendar year, whereas ‘Deposit Late’ indicates depositing $6,000 on December 1 of the same calendar year, both every year for a ten-year period. Calculations assume a hypothetical growth rate of 10% annually. The hypothetical growth rate is not based on, and should not be interpreted to reflect, any Betterment portfolio, or any other investment or portfolio, and is purely an arbitrary number. Further, the results are solely based on the calculations mentioned in the preceding sentences. These figures do not take into account any dividend reinvestment, taxes, market changes, or any fees charged. The illustration does not reflect the chance for loss or gain, and actual returns can vary from those above. What’s an IRA recharacterization? You might contribute to an IRA before you have started filing your taxes and may not know exactly what your Modified Adjusted Gross Income will be for that year. Therefore, you may not know whether you will be eligible to contribute to a Roth IRA, or if you will be able to deduct your contributions to a Traditional IRA. In some cases, the IRS allows you to reclassify your IRA contributions. A recharacterization changes your contributions (plus the gains or minus the losses attributed to them) from a Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA, or, from a Roth IRA to a Traditional IRA. It’s most common to recharacterize a Roth IRA to a Traditional IRA. Generally, there are no taxes associated with a recharacterization if the amount you recharacterize includes gains or excludes dollars lost. Here are three instances where a recharacterization may be right for you: If you made a Roth contribution during the year but discovered later that your income was high enough to reduce the amount you were allowed to contribute—or prohibit you from contributing at all. If you contributed to a Traditional IRA because you thought your income would be above the allowed limits for a Roth IRA contribution, but your income ended up lower than you’d expected. If you contributed to a Roth IRA, but while preparing your tax return, you realize that you’d benefit more from the immediate tax deduction a Traditional IRA contribution would potentially provide. Additionally, we have listed a few methods that can be used to correct an over-contribution to an IRA in this FAQ resource. You cannot recharacterize an amount that’s more than your allowable maximum annual contribution. You have until each year’s tax filing deadline to recharacterize—unless you file for an extension or you file an amended tax return. What’s a Roth conversion? A Roth conversion is a one-way street. It’s a potentially taxable event where funds are transferred from a Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA. There is no such thing as a Roth to Traditional conversion. It is different from a recharacterization because you are not changing the type of IRA that you contributed to for that particular year. There is no cap on the amount that’s eligible to be converted, so the sky’s the limit for those that choose to convert. We go into Roth conversions in more detail in our Help Center. So what’s right for you? Since your employer offers a 401(k) through Betterment, it’s typically best to start there. Some employers auto-enroll new hires, meaning that paycheck contributions start automatically. Whether your employer auto-enrolls or not, you’ll need to start by claiming your 401(k) account. Once you claim your account, you can set or adjust the contribution rate. Get started here: betterment.com/accountaccess. After you’ve got your 401(k) up and running, you might want to consider contributing to an IRA as well. On your dashboard, select “Add new” in the left-hand navigation, then choose: IRA. Follow the prompts to select which type of IRA you want, and sync a bank account to contribute from. You’ll have access to the same investment options available in your 401(k). Retirement can feel hard to plan for, but Betterment has plenty of investing options to make it easy to save for. We’re here to help you work towards for the retirement of your dreams.

                                 <div class="js-post-body-count" aria-hidden="true" hidden="">
                                    Investing in Your 40s: 4 Financial Goals You Should Prioritize at Mid-Life  In your 40s, your priorities and investing goals become clearer than ever; it’s your mid-life opportunity to get your goals on track. It’s easy to put off planning for the future when the present is so demanding. Unlike in your 20s and 30s when your retirement seemed like a distant event, your 40s are when your financial responsibilities become palpable—now and for retirement. You may be earning more income than ever, so you can benefit far more from planning your taxes carefully. Perhaps you have increased expenses as a result of homeownership. If you have kids, now may also be the time that you’re thinking about or preparing to pay for college tuition. When all of these elements of your financial life converge, they require some thoughtful planning and strategic investing. Consider the following roadmap to planning your investments wisely during these rewarding years of your life. Here are four ways to think about goals you might prepare for. Preparing for Your Next Phase: Four Goals for Your 40s You may have already made a plan for the future. If so, now is a good time to review it and adjust course if necessary. If you haven’t yet made a plan, it’s not too late to get started. Set aside some time to think about your situation and long-term goals. If you’re married or in a relationship, you likely may need to include your spouse or partner in identifying your goals. Consider the facts: How much are you making? How much do you spend? Will your spending needs be changing in the near future? (Perhaps you're paying for day care right now but can plan to redirect that amount towards savings in a few years instead.) How much are you setting aside for savings, investments, and retirement? What will you need in the next five, 10, or 20 years? Work these factors into your short- and long-term financial goals. Pay off high-interest debt The average credit card interest rate is more than 20%, so paying off any high-interest credit card debt can boost your financial security more than almost any other financial move you make related to savings or investing. Student loans may also be a high-cost form of debt, especially if you borrowed money when rates were higher. If you have a high-interest-rate student loan (say more than 5%), or if you have multiple loans that you’d like to consolidate, you may want to consider refinancing your student debt. These days, lenders offer many options to refinance higher-rate student loans. There’s one form of debt that you don’t necessarily need to repay early, however: your mortgage. This is because mortgage rates are lower than most credit cards and may offer you a tax break. If you itemize deductions, you may be able to subtract mortgage interest from your taxable income. Many people file using the standard deduction, however, so check with your tax professional about what deductions may apply to your situation come tax time. Check that you’re saving enough for retirement If you’ve had several jobs—which means you might have several retirement or 401(k) plans—now is a good time to organize and check how all of your investments have performed. Betterment can help you accomplish this by allowing you to connect and review your outside accounts. Connecting external accounts allows you to see your wealth in one place and align different accounts to your financial goals. Connecting your accounts in Betterment can also help you see higher investment management fees you might be paying, grab opportunities to invest idle cash, and determine how your portfolios are allocated when we are able to pull that data from other institutions. There could also be several potential benefits of consolidating your various retirement accounts into low-fee IRA accounts at Betterment. Because it’s much easier to get on track in your 40s than in your 50s since you have more time to invest, you should also check in on the advice personalized for you in a Betterment retirement goal. Creating a Retirement goal at Betterment allows you to build a customized retirement plan to help you understand how much you’ll need to save for retirement based on when and where you plan on retiring. The plan also considers current and future income—including Social Security income—as well as your 401(k) accounts and other savings. Your plan updates regularly, and when you connect all of your outside accounts, it provides even more personalized retirement guidance. Optimize your taxes In your 40s, you’re likely to be earning more than earlier in your career–which may put you in a higher tax bracket. Reviewing your tax situation can help make sure you are keeping as much of your hard-earned income as you can. Determine if you should be investing in a Roth (after-tax contribution) or traditional (pre-tax contribution) employer plan option, or an IRA. The optimal choice usually depends on your current income versus your expected income in retirement. If your income is higher now than you expect it to be in retirement, it’s generally better to use a traditional 401(k) and take the tax deduction. If your income is similar or less than what you expect in retirement, you should consider choosing a Roth if available. Those without employer plans can generally take traditional IRA deductions no matter what their taxable income is (as long as your spouse doesn’t have one, either). You’ll also want to make sure you take advantage of all the tax credits and deductions that may be available to you. You may also want to check to see whether your company offers tax-free transportation benefits—including subway or bus passes or commuter parking. The value of these benefits isn’t included in your taxable income, so you can save money. You can also save money on a pre-tax basis by contributing to a Health Savings Account (HSA) or Flexible Spending Account (FSA). Health Saving Accounts (HSA) Health savings accounts (HSAs) are like personal savings accounts, but the money in them is used to pay for health care expenses. Only you—not your employer or insurance company—own and control the money in your HSA. The money you deposit into the account is not taxed. To be eligible to open an HSA, you must have a high-deductible insurance plan. Your 401(k) may be tied to your employer, however your HSA is not. As long as your health plan meets the deductible requirement and permits you to open an HSA, and you’re not receiving Medicare benefits or claimed as a dependent on someone else’s tax return, you can open one with various HSA “administrators” or “custodians” such as banks, credit unions, insurance companies, and other financial institutions. You can withdraw the funds tax-free at any time for qualified medical expenses. Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA) A Flexible Spending Account (FSA) is a special account that can be used to save for certain out-of-pocket health care costs. You don’t pay taxes on this money—this is a tax-favored program that some employers offer to their employees. If you have an FSA, remember that in most cases your spending allowance does not carry over from year-to-year. It’s important to find out whether your employer offers a grace period into the next year (typically through mid-March) to spend down your account. Before you waste your tax-free savings on eyeglasses, check what you can buy with FSA money—with and without a prescription. Any unused funds will be forfeited, so it’s a good idea to use up what you can. If you find yourself with more than you can spend, then you might want to adjust how much you’re allocating to your FSA. If you have children, start saving for college—just don’t shortchange your retirement to do it If you have children, you may already be paying for their college tuition, or at least preparing to pay for it. It’s advisable to focus on your own financial security while also doing what you can to save for your kids’ college costs. So, first things first, make sure you’re saving enough for your own retirement. Then if you have money left over, think about tax-deferred college savings plans, such as 529 plans. A 529—named for the section of the tax code that allows for them—can be a great way to save for college because earnings are tax-free if used for qualified education expenses. Some states even allow you to deduct contributions from your state income tax, if you use your state’s plan. (While each state has its own plan, you can use any state’s plan, no matter where your child will go to college.) An alternative is to put money away in your own taxable savings accounts. Some investors prefer this method since it gives them more control over the money if things change, and may be more beneficial for financial aid. Your 40s are all about taking stock of how far you’ve come, re-adjusting your priorities, and getting ready for the next phase of life. By working on your financial goals now, you can gain peace of mind that allows you to concentrate on important things like family, friends, work, and the way you want to spend this rewarding decade of your life.

                                    How to turn your retirement savings into retirement income  An income strategy during retirement can help make your portfolio last longer, while also easing potential tax burdens. Retirement planning doesn’t end when you retire. To have the retirement you’ve been dreaming of, you need to ensure your savings will last. And how much you withdraw each month isn’t all that matters. In this guide we’ll cover: What a retirement income plan is How much to withdraw each year Which accounts you should withdraw from first Why changes in the market affect you differently in retirement How to handle a market downturn when you’re nearing retirement How Betterment helps take the guesswork out of your retirement income What is retirement income planning? You’ll likely spend decades saving and investing for retirement. But when that big moment comes, what happens next? If you’ve been diligently setting aside cash, you might have upwards of a million dollars to manage. That’s certainly something to be proud of: It puts you in a great position—and also comes with new responsibilities. Think of it this way: You’ve been getting a paycheck from your employer regularly for 30 to 40 years. Now you’re the one cutting those checks. So,how do you make the most of your assets? What is the best way to turn them into a stream of sustainable income that will, hopefully, last you through retirement? “Retirement income planning” is a broad phrase to help you think about how to prepare for the “spend down” years (as opposed to the “saving up” years). Financial professionals used to refer to the “three-legged stool” of retirement income planning: Social Security, a pension, and personal savings. Considering that pensions are hardly used anymore, and the future of Social Security is murky, we’re more-or-less down to one leg: personal savings. But in today’s world, personal savings can incorporate a few different cash streams – personal investment accounts, Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs), and of course – a 401(k). All of which can play a role in your retirement income plan. Why changes in the market affect you differently in retirement Stock markets can swing up or down at any time. They’re volatile. When you’re saving for a distant retirement, you usually don’t have to worry as much about temporary dips. But during retirement, market volatility can have a greater effect on your savings. An investment account is a collection of individual assets. When you make a withdrawal from your retirement account, you’re selling off assets to equal the amount you want to withdraw. So say the market is going through a temporary dip. Since you’re retired, you have to continue making withdrawals in order to maintain your income. During the dip, your investment assets may have less value, so you have to sell more of them to equal the same amount of money. When the market goes back up, you have fewer assets that benefit from the rebound. The opposite is true, too. When the market is up, you don’t have to sell as many of your assets to maintain your income. There will always be good years and bad years in the market. How your withdrawals line up with the market’s volatility is called the “sequence of returns.” Unfortunately, you can’t control it. In many ways, it’s the luck of the withdrawal. Still, there are ways to help decrease the potential impact of a bad sequence of returns. How to limit bad timing from ruining your retirement The last thing you want is to retire and then lose your savings to market volatility. Consider taking some steps to try and protect your retirement from a bad sequence of returns. Adjust your level of risk As you near or enter retirement, it’s likely time to start dialing down your stock-to-bond allocation. Invest too heavily in stocks, and your retirement savings could tank right when you need them. Betterment generally recommends turning down your ratio to about 56% stocks in early retirement, then gradually decreasing to about 30% toward the end of retirement. Rebalance your portfolio During retirement, the two most common cash flows in/out of your investment accounts will likely be dividends you earn and withdrawals you make. If you’re strategic, you can use these cash flows as opportunities to rebalance your portfolio. For example, if stocks are down at the moment, you likely want to withdraw from your bonds instead. This can help prevent you from selling stocks at a loss. Alternatively, if stocks are rallying, you may want to reinvest your dividends into bonds (instead of cashing them out) in order to bring your portfolio back into balance with your preferred ratio of stocks to bonds. Keep an emergency fund Even in retirement, it’s important to have an emergency fund. If you keep a separate account in your portfolio with enough money to cover three to six months of expenses, you can likely cushion—or ride out altogether—the blow of a bad sequence of returns. Supplement your income Hopefully, you’ll have enough retirement savings to produce a steady income from withdrawals. But it’s nice to have other income sources, too, to minimize your reliance on investment withdrawals in the first place. While there still is Social Security—it’s future is murky. Maybe you have a pension you can withdraw from, too. Or a part-time job. Or rental properties. Along with the other precautions above, these additional income sources can help counter bad returns early in retirement. While you can’t control your sequence of returns, you can control the order you withdraw from your accounts. And that’s important, too. How much should you withdraw each year Deciding how much to withdraw annually from your 401(k) once you’re retired involves balancing anticipated expenses with available savings. You’ll want to consider tax implications, market fluctuations, inflation, health/longevity, and additional income streams (more on this below). A good place to start is with the 4% rule, which entails withdrawing 4% of your retirement savings in the first year, then adjusting the amount annually for inflation. Keep in mind: the 4% rule typically assumes your portfolio is split almost evenly between stocks and bonds, and that your funds are held in a tax-deferred account, such as a traditional IRA or 401(k), where withdrawals are taxable. Although the 4% rule has been popular for decades, it's applicability has been challenged in recent years. Longer lifespans, healthcare costs, inflation rates, and additional income streams have all changed the economic landscape. Ultimately, there is no one-size-fits-all answer to how much you should withdraw annually in retirement. A financial advisor can help you create a roadmap that’s right for you in retirement. Which accounts to withdraw from first In retirement, taxes are usually one of your biggest expenses. They’re right up there with healthcare costs. When it comes to your retirement savings, there are three “tax pools” your accounts can fall under: Taxable accounts: individual accounts, joint accounts, and trusts. Tax-deferred accounts: individual retirement accounts (IRAs), 401(k)s, 403(b)s, and Thrift Savings Plans Tax-free accounts: Roth IRAs, Roth 401(k)s Each of these account types (taxable, tax-deferred, and tax-free) are taxed differently—and that’s important to understand when you start making withdrawals. When you have funds in all three tax pools, this is known as “tax diversification.” This strategy can create some unique opportunities for managing your retirement income. For example, when you withdraw from your taxable accounts, you only pay taxes on the capital gains, not the full amount you withdraw. With a tax-deferred account like a Traditional 401(k), you usually pay taxes on the full amount you withdraw, so with each withdrawal, taxes take more away from your portfolio’s future earning potential. Since you don’t have to pay taxes on withdrawals from your tax-free accounts, it’s typically best to save these for last. You want as much tax-free money as possible, right? So, while we’re not a tax advisor, and none of this information should be considered advice for your specific situation, the ideal withdrawal order generally-speaking is: Taxable accounts Tax-deferred accounts Tax-free accounts But there are a few exceptions. Incorporating minimum distributions Once you reach a certain age, you must generally begin taking required minimum distributions (RMDs) from your tax-deferred accounts. Failure to do so results in a steep penalty on the amount you were supposed to take. This changes things—but only slightly. At this point, you may want to consider following a new order: Withdraw your RMDs. If you still need more, then pull from taxable accounts. When there’s nothing left in those, start withdrawing from your tax-deferred accounts. Pull money from tax-free accounts. Smoothing out bumps in your tax bracket In retirement, you’ll likely have multiple sources of non-investment income, coming from Social Security, defined benefit pensions, rental income, part-time work, and/or RMDs. Since these income streams vary from year to year, your tax bracket may fluctuate throughout retirement. With a little extra planning, you can sometimes use these fluctuations to your advantage. For years where you’re in a lower bracket than usual–say, if you’re retiring before you plan on claiming Social Security benefits–it may make sense to fill these low brackets with withdrawals from tax-deferred accounts before touching your taxable accounts, and possibly consider Roth conversions. For years where you’re in a higher tax bracket, like if you sell a home and end up with large capital gains–it may make sense to pull from tax-free accounts first to minimize the effect of higher tax rates. Remember, higher taxes mean larger withdrawals and less money staying invested.

                                 <p class="item-title">What is a Required Minimum Distribution?</p>
                                 <div class="js-post-body-count" aria-hidden="true" hidden="">
                                    What is a Required Minimum Distribution?  In exchange for all of the tax advantages 401(k)s provided during your accumulation years, by law, you will need to start taking distributions from your account when you turn 72. 401(k) plans can help you save for retirement in a tax-advantaged way. However, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) requires that you start taking withdrawals from their qualified retirement accounts when you reach the age 72. These withdrawals are called required minimum distributions (RMDs). Why do I have to take RMDs? In exchange for the tax advantages you enjoy by contributing to your 401(k) plan, the IRS requests collection of taxes on these amounts when you turn 72. The IRS taxes RMDs as ordinary income, meaning withdrawals will count towards your total taxable income for the year. Generally, the IRS collects taxes on the gains in retirement accounts such as 401(k)s. However, if Roth 401(k) account assets are held for at least 5 years, Roth 401(k) funds are not taxed. Because there are taxes being paid to the government, these distributions are NOT eligible for rollover to another account. How much do I have to withdraw? RMDs are calculated based on your age and your account balance as of the end of the previous year. To determine the required distribution amount, Betterment divides your previous year’s ending account balance by your life expectancy factor (based on your age) from the IRS’ uniform lifetime table. If you had no balance at the end of the previous year, then your first RMD will not occur until the following year. Additionally, if you have taken a cash distribution from your 401(k) account in any given year you are subject to an RMD, and that distribution amount is equal to or greater than the RMD amount, that distribution will qualify as the required amount and no additional distribution is required. Does everyone who turns 72 need to take an RMD? Turning 72 in a given year doesn’t mean that you have to take an RMD. Only those who turn 72 in a given year AND meet any of the following criteria must take an RMD: You have taken an RMD in previous years. If so, then you must take an RMD by December 31 of every year. You own more than 5% of the company sponsoring the 401(k) plan. If so, then you must take an RMD by December 31 every year. You have left the company (terminated or retired) in the year you turned 72. If so, then the first RMD does not need to occur until April 1 (otherwise known as the Required Beginning Date) of the following year, but must occur consecutively by December 31 for every year. Example: John turned 72 on June 1, 2022. John also decided to leave his company on August 1, 2022. He has been continuously contributing to his 401(k) account for the past 5 years. The first RMD must occur by April 1, 2023. The next RMD must occur by December 31, 2023 and every year thereafter. You are a beneficiary or alternate payee of an account holder who meets the above criteria. If you are 72 and still employed, you do NOT need to take an RMD. What are the consequences of not taking an RMD? Failure to take an RMD for a given year will result in a penalty of 50% of the amount not taken on time by the IRS. How do I take an RMD? Betterment will automatically process your RMD if we see that you are over age 72 and no longer actively employed with your employer. If you have the option to take an RMD - age 72 but still employed - your employer can provide you with a form to submit a request. If you have a linked bank account on file, the RMD will be deposited into that account; if we do not have a bank account on file, a check will be mailed to the address in your account.

                                 <div class="js-post-body-count" aria-hidden="true" hidden="">
                                    Investing in Your 50s: 4 Practical Tips for Retirement Planning  In your 50s, assess your retirement plan, lifestyle, earnings, and support for family. Practice goal-based investing to help meet your objectives. As you enter your 50s, you may feel like your long-term goals are coming within reach, and it’s up to you to make sure those objectives are realized. Now is also a perfect time to see how your investments and retirement savings are shaping up. If you’ve cut back on savings to meet big expenses, such as home repairs and (if you have children) college tuition, you now have an opportunity to make up lost ground. You might also think about how you want to live after you retire. Will you relocate? Will you downsize or stay put? If you have children, how much are you willing to support them as they enter adulthood? These decisions all matter when deciding how to strategize your investments for this important decade of your life. Four Goals for Your 50s Your 50s can be a truly productive and efficient time for your investments. Focus on achieving these four key goals to make these years truly count in retirement. Goal 1: Assess Your Retirement Accounts If you’ve put retirement savings on the back burner, or just want to make a push for greater financial security—the good news is that you can make larger contributions toward employer retirement accounts (401(k), 403(b), etc.) at age 50 and over, thanks to the IRS rules on catch-up contributions. If you’re already contributing the maximum to your employer plans and still want to save more for retirement, consider opening a traditional or Roth IRA. These are individual retirement accounts that are subject to their own contribution limits, but also allow for a catch-up contribution at age 50 or older. You may also wish to simplify your investments by consolidating your retirement accounts with IRA rollovers. Doing so can help you get more organized, streamline recordkeeping and make it easier to implement an overall retirement strategy. Plus, by consolidating now, you can help avoid complications after age 72, when you’ll have to make Required Minimum Distributions from all the tax-deferred retirement accounts you own. Goal 2: Evaluate Your Lifestyle and Pre-Retirement Finances When you’re in your 50s, you may still be a ways from retirement, however you’ll want to consider how to support yourself when you do begin that stage of your life. If you’ve just begun calculating how much you’ll need to save for a comfortable retirement, consider the following tips and tools. Tips and Tools for Estimating Income Needs Make a rough estimate of how much you spend on housing, food, utilities, health care, clothing, and incidentals. Nowadays, tools such as Mint® and Prosper include budgeting features that can help you see these expenditures. Subtract what you can expect to receive from Social Security. You can estimate your benefit with this calculator. Subtract any defined pension plan benefits or other sources of income you expect to receive in retirement. Subtract what you can safely withdraw each year from your retirement savings. Consider robust retirement planning tools, which can help you understand how much you’ll need to save for a comfortable retirement based on current and future income from all sources, and even your location. If there’s a gap between your income needs and your anticipated retirement income, you may need to make adjustments in the form of cutting expenses, working more years before retiring, increasing the current amounts you’re investing for retirement, and re-evaluating your investment strategy. Think About Taxes Your income may peak in your 50s, which can also push you into higher tax brackets. This makes tax-saving strategies like these potentially more valuable than ever: Putting more into tax-advantaged investing vehicles like 401(k)s or traditional IRAs. Donating appreciated assets to charities. Implementing tax-efficient investment strategies within your investments, such as tax loss harvesting* and asset location. Betterment automates both of these strategies and offers features to customers with no additional management fee. Define Your Lifestyle Your 50s are a great time to think about your current and desired lifestyle. As you near retirement, you’ll want to continue doing the things you love to do, or perhaps be able to start doing more and build on those passions. Perhaps you know you’ll be traveling more frequently. If you are socially active and enjoy entertainment activities such as dining out and going to the theater, those interests likely won’t change. Instead, you’ll want to enjoy doing all the things you love to do, but with the peace of mind knowing that you won’t be infringing on your retirement reserves. Say you want to start a new business when you leave your job. You’re not alone; more than a third of new entrepreneurs starting businesses in 2021 were between the ages of 55 and 64 according to research by the Kauffman Foundation. To get ready, you’ll want to start building or leveraging your contacts, creating a business plan, and setting up a workspace. You may also wish to consider relocating during retirement. Living in a warmer part of the country or moving closer to family is certainly appealing. Downsizing to a smaller home or even an apartment could cut down on utilities, property taxes, and maintenance. You might need one car instead of two—or none at all—if you relocate to a neighborhood surrounded by amenities within walking distance. If you sell your primary home, you can take advantage of a break on capital gains —even if you don’t use the money to buy another one. If you’ve lived in the same house for at least two out of the last five years, you can exclude capital gains of up to $250,000 per individual and $500,000 per married couple from your income taxes, according to the IRS. Goal 3: Chart Your Pre-Retirement Investment Strategy After you’ve determined how much you’ll need for a comfortable retirement, now’s also a good time to begin thinking about how you’ll use the assets you’ve accumulated to generate income after you retire. If you have shorter-term financial objectives over the next two to five years—such as paying for your kids’ college tuition, or a major home repair—you’ll have to plan accordingly. For these milestones, consider goal-based investing, where each goal will have different exposure to market risk depending on the time allocated for reaching that goal. Goal-based investing matches your time horizon to your asset allocation, which means you take on an appropriate amount of risk for your respective goals. Investments for short-term goals may be better allocated to less volatile assets such as bonds, while longer-term goals have the ability to absorb greater risks but also achieve greater returns. When you misallocate, it can lead to saving too much or too little, missing out on returns with too conservative an allocation, or missing your goal if you take on too much risk. Setting long investment goals shouldn’t be taken lightly. This is a moment of self-evaluation. In order to invest for the future, you must cut back on spending your wealth now. That means tomorrow’s goals in retirement must outweigh the pleasures of today’s spending. If you’re a Betterment customer, it’s easy to get started with goal-based investing. Simply set up a goal with your desired time horizon and target balance and Betterment will recommend an investment approach tailored to this information. Goal 4: Set Clear Expectations with Children If you have children, there’s nothing more satisfying than watching your kids turn into motivated adults with passions to pursue. As a parent, you’ll naturally want to prepare them with everything you can to help them succeed in the world. You may be wrapping up paying for their college tuition, which is no easy feat given that these costs – even at public in-state universities – now average in the tens of thousands of dollars per year. As your kids move through college, take the time to have a serious discussion with them about what they plan to do after graduation. If graduate school is on the horizon, talk to them about how they’ll pay for it and how much help from you, if any, they can expect. Unlike undergraduate programs, graduate programs assess financial aid requirements by looking at only the student’s assets and incomes, not the parents’, so your finances won't be considered. You’ll also want to set expectations about other kinds of support—such as any help in paying for their health insurance premiums up to a certain age, or their mobile phone plan, or even whether toward major purchases like a home or car. It’s great to help out your children, but you’ll want to make sure you’re not jeopardizing your own security. Your 50s may demand a lot from you, but taking the time to properly assess your investments, personal financial situation, lifestyle, and, if applicable, your support for children, can be truly rewarding in your retirement years. By tackling these four goals now, you can help set yourself up to meet your current responsibilities and increase your chances of a more financially secure and comfortable life in the decades to come.

Your employer chose us to manage your 401(k) because we make saving for retirement simple. But that's not all. We also offer a number of investing and cash accounts, all of which are separate from your employer's 401(k) plan. We make it easy to invest the way you want, with a range of diversified portfolios of stocks and bonds, or even crypto. Meanwhile, we handle the hard stuff, like monitoring your investments, reinvesting your dividends, and rebalancing your portfolio.</p>\n<p data-slate-node=\"element\">Okay, now let's talk about cash. Betterment allows you to grow your savings with a high yield cash account with no fees, $2million dollars in FDIC insurance through our program banks and unlimited withdrawals.</p>\n<p data-slate-node=\"element\">So you can leave your 401(k) alone if you have any unexpected or expected expenses. Say that three times fast.</p>\n<p data-slate-node=\"element\">Which brings us back to retirement. You're already on the right track saving with your 401(k), but additional savings like an IRA, an individual retirement account can sometimes be a smart strategy to further build out your retirement plan.</p>\n<p data-slate-node=\"element\">The short version? Betterment makes it simple for you to save, invest, and plan for all your financial goals conveniently in one app. So you can focus on the life you want today, tomorrow, and well into retirement.</p>\n<p data-slate-node=\"element\"

Let's kick things off with our Core Portfolio, the most popular pick of Betterment investors and the default option for 401(k) customers like yourself.</p>\n<p>Core features a broad collection of stocks and bonds from across the world, with a slight lean towards undervalued US stocks. If you're simply looking for a slice of the market at large, this portfolio could be for you.</p>\n<p>We have three varieties of Socially Responsible Investing portfolios.</p>\n<p>They offer a way for you to support companies that share your values. There's the Broad Impact Portfolio and two others, which lean more toward climate or social issues.</p>\n<p>Our Innovative Technology Portfolio invest in companies pioneering advances in semiconductors, nanotechnology, and more. If you believe the emerging tech of today will drive the market returns of tomorrow, and you're willing to take on a little extra risk, this portfolio is made with you in mind.</p>\n<p>Our Goldman Sachs Smart Beta Portfolio targets companies with the potential to outperform the broader market in the long term based on certain characteristics. But it also comes with a higher risk of occasional losses.</p>\n<p>If you're looking to preserve wealth or generate income in retirement, we offer the BlackRock Portfolio. It's built entirely on a diverse set of bonds to help minimize stock market volatility. Pick from one of four options targeting varying levels of income and corresponding risk.</p>\n<p>Last but not least, if you're an experienced investor looking for more control, a Flexible Portfolio lets you adjust the weights of individual asset classes.</p>\n<p>We'll rate the diversification and relative risk of your tweaks before making anything final.</p>\n<p>One more time, here's your Betterment portfolio options.

First, you'll be prompted to choose a contribution rate. This is the amount from each paycheck that will be automatically invested. Your employer may have already set an initial rate for you, but you can change it.</p>\n<p>When deciding how much to contribute, keep in mind a couple of things.</p>\n<p>First, most experts recommend contributing 10% to 15% of your paycheck for retirement. If you can't swing that now, you can start small and work your way up each year. Second, it's important that you save something, especially if your employer offers a matching contribution.</p>\n<p>After picking a contribution rate, comes the fun part, picking an investment portfolio. You automatically start in the Core portfolio. But here's where you can learn more about other options and make a switch. We offer portfolios built by investing experts, with global diversification, low costs, and long-term performance in mind.</p>\n<p>Last, but not least, don't forget your old 401(k)s from previous jobs.</p>\n<p>One estimate puts the amount of money employees forget in old 401(k)s at $1.35 trillion.</p>\n<p>Are any of those dollars yours? Rolling over an old 401(k) could help you avoid potential high fees and access Betterment's rebalancing and tax coordination tools.</p>\n<p>So there you have it, three easy steps to get started investing with Betterment.

Your employer chose us to manage your 401(k) because we make saving for retirement simple.</p>\n<p>What's a 401(k)?</p>\n<p>It's a popular type of account to save and invest for retirement.</p>\n<p>And why is it used by so many people?</p>\n<p>Three main reasons.</p>\n<p>First, you can contribute significantly more to it than an IRA, another type of tax advantaged retirement account. So much so that it's likely to be your main source of income when you retire.</p>\n<p>Second, you contribute to it automatically from your paycheck.</p>\n<p>So it's one less thing to think about.</p>\n<p>Last but not least, when invested wisely, your 401(k) can unlock the power of compound interest.</p>\n<p>History has shown that's how you start to see the snowball effect.</p>\n<p>For all these reasons you don't want to wait another day to get started saving for retirement. And Betterment is here to help.
